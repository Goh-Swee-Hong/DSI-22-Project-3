0,What’s Up Wednesday,"It’s that day again. Guess what day it is? Happy Hump Day, everybody! What's Up Wednesdays are when we sobernauts celebrate the sober life, see how our SD family is doing, and support each other. Share your good, your bad, and your ugly (or your pretty, or your future, or your funny, or whatever else is on your mind) with us below!

-----------------------------------------

**The Good:** I have reconciled with my brother, to whom I was not speaking at one point.

**The Bad:** When I was a drinker, people used to complain that they drank too much when I was around, and I worried I that was what another sobernaut on this sub called a “drinkstigator.” Once, my mother’s boyfriend told my mother, “I only drank so much last night because Mary was here.” (She replied, “Don’t try to blame your drinking on my daughter.”) 

Now that I’m sober, people complain about “not being able to have fun” (meaning drink) around me—even though I’ve repeatedly said that I’m totally comfortable with other people drinking.

It’s maddening, because this seems like the flip side of being a drinkstigator (the sober-stigator?)—as if what I have in my glass somehow magically dictates how other people must behave. It’s difficult enough to be responsible for my own choices about drinking and sobriety—why are they trying to make me responsible for theirs, too?

**The Funny:** “I told my mother that she should embrace her mistakes . . . and she gave me a hug.”",t3_o0z9ja
1,"The Daily Check-In for Wednesday, June 16th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Do you have a sober safe room?

One very common challenge for new soberistas is to have some place without alcohol. A sober safe room.

I´m spending much time in my garden. Digging, pruning, watering, watching things grow. Wait... isn´t that even slower than watching paint dry? Yes. Which is why I look, do something else, come back, and lo and behold, sweet peas have magically appeared from out of nowhere. The cucumber has gotten more flowers. Strawberries have turned red. It doesn´t happen while I watch, but it happens, and over time, I can see it.

You see the punchline from far away, right... this is how it is with my sobriety too. Entering the safe room not only gives me a much needed *safe room*, it allows me to assess the situation, see my progress, and gather strenght and motivation to keep going. Some days the progress is obvious, other days it´s long lines. But it´s there.

Do you have a safe room? Can you create one?

I will not drink with you today!",t3_o0z9nf
2,Marriage is Over,"My wife, my best friend, my everything, saved my life. She has been my biggest supporter, my lifeline through this journey. She did everything she could; she was in al-anon, had her own therapist, got me into treatment multiple times, did all the things she could. I relapsed last November, and that series of lies broke her trust for good. We worked with a therapist starting in February, but the damage is too great, the wounds too deep. She hurts too much, and can never trust me again.

I tried and failed many times, and it wasn't until January/February of this year when I finally had my 'aha' moment, when it all clicked. I finally understood, after three 30 day in-patient stays, 8 detoxes, 21 additional hospitalizations, 2 seizures, 2 broken ribs, a punctured lung, plastic surgery to repair my face, trauma dentistry to fix teeth, countless broken hearts, different therapists, all within 8 months, I finally understood that I drank not because of childhood trauma or grad school or anything else. I drank because of my own discomfort with myself. I drank because I hated the person I had become, so much so I couldn't look in the mirror. My biggest problem was me trying to be perfect, trying to control everything, trying to manage every minute detail of my life to my own self-imposed standard of perfect. I finally realized that no amount of treatment or injury would have made me realize the problem until I got out of my own way, got out of the driver's seat, and live life on life's terms, not mine. 

Once I made this realization, that I was my biggest problem, my way of thinking, that I needed to re-evaluate how I make decisions, how I live life, and what my priorities are, it was like a weight had been lifted. I could breathe for the first time in 2 years and not feel like I was holding on for life. I finally realized that I was the thing standing in the way of recovery, not some mysterious or buried event in my past. I had to step aside, worry only about the things in my control for the next 24 hours, and leave everything else in the hands of something else, be it my AA home group, higher power, or anything that wasn't me. That was the only way I could finally see it. 

But it came too late. The person I love the most in this world is too hurt, too broken, and can give no more. She saved my life at the sacrifice of her own, and I fear I have no way of making good on that debt. I just want her to be safe and happy, to know that she will be OK. I fear I will take that regret to the grave. 

She is the strongest, sweetest, purest soul I have ever met, and I have no idea how I will do this life without her. I just wish I had made this realization sooner. 

I've got a therapist, sponsor, and tons of great people in and out of the rooms, including here, who I have and will continue to reach out to, but I just wanted to share my experience here as well. Alcohol will only make any situation worse, and I will continue to try to cope with my own discomfort and stay out of my own way. Thanks for letting me share.

Edit: I cannot begin to thank each and every one of you for reaching out with comments and messages, for sharing your own stories, and for helping me and many others have a sober, rewarding night of being better than we were yesterday. I planned on trying to respond to each comment, as every one of them means something to me, but I did not anticipate my post getting this much attention. There are still a lot of shares that deeply touched me, and I will try to respond to those later tonight or tomorrow. Each of you has helped me take another step in the right direction, and I thank you for that. 

I hope each of you gets a sober, restful sleep and has a positive and strong day tomorrow when it arrives.",t3_o16z5e
3,Sobriety did this.,"I just got offered my dream position with an incredible salary and benefits. 

I’ve been putting off applying for jobs and updating my resume because I’m always too drunk to do so, but sobriety gave me my time back. 

And now it’s paid off.

I couldn’t have done this without sobriety. 

Thank you guys for the push to keep trying. 

I’m still not there. Not by a long shot.

But I will be.",t3_o1h9vc
4,30 days but forgot two bottles...,"I'm a month sober, after I had a total psychotic break from reality that ended in me screaming at my two best friends on the street. Not cute.

One month ago, I dumped everything down the drain - even the simple syrup! - and gave my fresh box of mail-order wine to my in-laws. Today, while making room for a big Costco order, I found some stragglers - two bottles of nice wine.

I'm home alone and I thought to myself as I opened the bottles to dump, ""Would I die if I had just one little sip? No one would know."" It became all the more tempting smelling the wine go down the drain. I loved the sour/bitter taste of alcohol! 

But I didn't give in and both bottles are empty. Rinsed the sink to get rid of the smell, having a cup of grapefruit juice for something tart and bitter. 31 days tomorrow.",t3_o1kqgt
5,Two years sober and celebrated with champagne last night,I drank champagne in my dreams last night. I was forced to and I hated the way it made me feel. Then I woke up to my 2 year soberversary. I imagine the drinking dreams will never stop completely but I'm always happy to wake up from them to the amazing life I have created for myself. They keep me grateful.,t3_o1h3wj

7,Great quote,"I was reading through Alcohol is Sh!t and came across this quote:

I drank for happiness and became unhappy.
I drank for joy and became miserable.
I drank for sociability and became argumentative. 
I drank for sophistication and became obnoxious.
I drank for friendships and became enemies. 
I drank for sleep and woke up tired.
I drank for strength and felt weak.
I drank for relaxation and got the shakes.
I drank for courage and became afraid.
I drank for confidence and became doubtful.
I drank to make conversation easier and slurred my speech.
I drank to feel heavenly and ended up feeling like hell. —Author unknown

Sums it up pretty well!",t3_o1ma3z

9,92 days. 3 whole months.,"And all I gotta say is that this is easily the best decision I ever made. And easily the hardest decision I ever made. 
But I wake up every day grateful that I didn't drink the day before. 

I'm a more loving, giving, present, and productive person all because I stopped drinking. 

I'm so damn proud of myself and all of us in here. It's not easy, but everyday we are choosing the best version of ourselves. 
I hope something good happens to you guys today. 
I hope you chose your best self just for today.

10,I hate alcohol,"Very hungover on my day one and just cannot wait to go to sleep and wake up feeling better. This sucks so bad. F alcohol, this is the WORST feeling. For those thinking of having a drink, trust me, DO NOT. THIS IS YOUR SIGN NOT TO DRINK. it’s definitely not worth it. I feel awful.",t3_o1jb3w
11,16 Days. Received a really shitty text message day,"I last drank 16 days ago. It was a particularly bad blackout. I don’t remember much, but I know that I heard some people hanging out in a neighbor’s yard around midnight. I don’t know these neighbors at all. I decided to walk into their yard and try and hang out, completely blacked out already. 

From what I’ve learned, it ended up being the neighbor’s college aged kid and friends. I’m 37. I did and said some stuff that got me kicked out and ended in a shouting match.  

I’ve felt so embarrassed and guilty since then. I’ve just avoided being outside at all costs. Over time, I started feeling somewhat better. But today, I just a text message from the neighbor, who I’ve never met. It was a very lengthy message that was very difficult to read. She told me what I did over there and how they feel about it. It’s really like my worst dream come true. I responded by apologizing profusely. 

I just don’t know where to go from here. I’m now filled with so much worry and anxiety I can barely function.",t3_o1kljm
12,Proud,"Hi all, so during the past few months, my mental health has been terrible. Been in a really dark spot- I was drinking more and more each day. Undoing all the hard work I done previously.

13,What are you looking forward to as you continue sobriety?,"Me:

1. Fresh, awake and alive mornings.
2. Not feeling like I've been ran over by a truck all of the time.
3. Worried that people can smell my booze breath. (they can, btw)
4. Using utensils without my hands shaking like crazy from the bender the night before.
5. Being THERE for my family, not just present while buzzed.

Just to name a few. IWNBDWYT",t3_o1fp6n
14,Two years,"731 days. 

There's really not much else to say. I'm proud of the accomplishment, but it's also in big part to the people of this subreddit sharing their stories of success and setback that has helped to make it possible.

15,18 days sober and learning to observe the river of the self hatred.,"I am 18 days sober and really beating myself up about every little thing. 

I am really disturbed at how bad of shape I am in. Hating myself for over eating as a way to self soothe these last few weeks. Wishing I was in better shape.
Confused at the severity and pervasive brain fog. Did I kill so many brain cells that my clarity and focus and energy will never return? 

I am exhausted. I could spend all day In bed and do nothing but eat. Unmotivated and Barely making it day to day. 

Does anyone else feel utterly exhausted being newly sober? Any advice for replenishing and healing my body and mind?

17,Bought a bottle of vodka today,"Poured some into seltzer water, took 2 sips… then was hit with “why am I doing this?”, and poured the whole brand new bottle down the drain

18,Thank god for the pepto in my desk,"Last year, before the pandemic, I had a bottle of pepto squirreled away in a desk drawer at work. It was needed, because I still hadn’t managed to really stop the drinking. Binge, feel miserable, drink pepto, pretend I did not drink too much the night before and hang out in my darkened office until the headache subsided. 

My whole family has food poisoning. Even the poor dogs. Thanks, pizza! But when I got in this morning after feeling somewhat better today, guess what I found? The pepto! Used for actual medicinal purposes instead of a hangover! I’m ridiculously grateful for this sub, and the moments of reflection here that have allowed me to stop torturing myself into needing pepto to function due to alcohol use. But I’m also grateful to past me for putting that bottle in that drawer right now! 

That’s all. Just wanted to share a moment of reflection on past habits. You guys rock. IWNDWYT.",t3_o15h30
19,5 years sober.,"[Obligatory artsy chip picture](https://imgur.com/a/vRxJ5PZ)

In February 2016 I started my sober journey here on r/stopdrinking. I actually made this account just to join the sub. 

I had been drinking heavily for 8 years. Started at college parties. Turned to the worse after my father died when I was 21 and continued to progress. I drank to escape how lonely I was and much I hated myself. I was actively suicidal for many years. I drank to escape the toxic and abusive relationships I kept getting myself into, and the emotional manipulation/abuse from my mom. 

I hit my rock bottom in late 2015/early 2016. The self-harm ideations had gotten worse. I had started driving drunk. I started blacking out. I needed more and more to even feel a buzz. I couldn’t go 24 hours without a drink. After a particularly scary blackout, I decided something needed to change. 

I came here and cut back on drinking. It was rough at first and I kept relapsing after a week or two. Finally, on June 9th, 2016, I decided that the awful bottle of Chardonnay I’d gotten wasted on the night before was my last drink. I reported to an AA meeting a few days later. 

I’m not super active in recovery circles anymore, but I’ve been going to therapy and slowly working on myself over the years. Since getting sober:

I got a good paying job that I (mostly!) love. 
I bought a house. 
I dumped the abusive relationship and have now been in a really happy and healthy relationship for the last 3 years. 
Came out as transgender (happy Pride btw y’all!) and have really been enjoying being my more authentic self. 
Have made huge progress in mental health and trauma recovery. 
Have discovered new hobbies (like gardening) and re-discovered old ones (photography, drawing, music)
Among other things!

I could not have done any of that drunk. I shudder to think where my life might have gone if I’d kept drinking. 

What helped me? The biggest thing was: dealing with my issues and my bullshit. Partially AA, partially therapy, a whole lot of journaling. 

Also: one day at a time. I know it sounds cheesy but it’s such a powerful phrase and I go back to it even now. 

And finally, that good old serenity prayer. Especially the (IMO underrated) second part: the courage to change the things I can. That was what I needed. 

Anyway - this is getting long so I will just finish with IWNDWYT!",t3_o1lpyy
20,16 days sober as a MF.,"16 days.

Been to 5 AA meetings in that time. No steps, no sponsor (yet), just support. And budding connections.

16 days that I havent even MISSED the poisonous shit.

This time feels different than all the other times I've tried to quit and failed.

I think it's because I'm actually going to meetings, and making it part of a routine, which is something I've never done before.

I think it's because the more I introduce myself in shares as an alcoholic and speak my truth the more I accept it.

I think it's because I feel understood by peers who are going through similar things and have a desire to be sober too.

IWNDWYT ❤",t3_o1k2zh
21,A good wine is not worth it anymore,"I haven't said this to anyone, and I'm keeping it to myself, except for the Reddit ether....

I have a problem.

And I feel like an imposter alcoholic, because I'm totally in control around most alcohols.

Except wine. Oh god, the wine.

It's almost like a cliche, and I hate that. White girl loves day drinking Pinot Grigio with her girlfriends. But I lose control. I can't have one glass, I have to have the bottle. Once I've started, my judgement goes out the window, and all other alcohol is fair game. 

I loudly rant like a crazy person. I get depressed and question every relationship. I throw up and blackout. I wake up with deep regrets about everything I've said and done while drunk, vow never to do it again, and end up buying another two bottles of wine. I've driven drunk a few times, something that brings me incredible shame and terror.

I cling desperately to the off hand comments made by others in order to rationalize my behavior. I'm going through a divorce, so it's okay to drink excessively. I got in a car accident with a hit and run driver, so I need a drink now. I'm having steak for dinner, and it's a law that good steak needs a good wine. It's a day ending in -y, so obviously it's the perfect time to drink. My coworkers like wine, so drinking entire bottles in one sitting is totally normal behavior. My friend got drunk last week at a special event, so I'm justified getting drunk three nights a week.

I'm done feeling out of control, and honestly, I'm done feeling angry about it. Anger that I can't just drink in fucking moderation. I can accept that my relationship with wine is terribly unhealthy, no matter how unfair I think it all is. Life is unfair, and I can choose to wallow in drunken self-pity, surprised that my attempts at moderation have backfired, or I can accept my problem and move on. Accepting my problem means cutting out all alcohol, so my resolve and judgment aren't weakened. I don't cry at the thought of never having a beer or a scotch, if it means never being wine-drunk again.

I know that I need to eventually tell the people in my life, but I'm scared. I've said so many times that I want to stop, and never do. It feels like verbalizing it will destroy my resolve, and I'll drink again. I can't be accountable to others if I'm not accountable to myself.

I still can't imagine the rest of my life without my best frenemy, wine.

I will not drink with you today.",t3_o17w8d
22,Made it 50 days,Never thought I could get this far with this much hope. Very thankful for this group and all the good homies that always got each others backs. Y’all the best. Here’s to 50 more.,t3_o1m3re
23,"I'm grumpy, exhausted, but sober","Had a very stressful day today at work, and that old nagging voice came screaming..  Have 1.. Its okay, everyone will understand.. blah blah blah. 

I decided to be honest with myself, I didn't just want one..  No, actually I would have hated just one. I wanted enough to forget this day and pass out drunk. That's what I wanted. Now this is the part where I say I'm so happy I didn't drink right ? 

Except I'm actually annoyed, mad, frustrated and exhausted. I'm tired and mad that I had to spend energy this evening doing this. I'm frustrated that my problems didn't disappear. However I am sober. I will wake up glad I am sober right now. I will be able to tackle my problems at work better now because I stayed sober. 

Here's to everyone who might be a salty grump tonight, but atleast we are sober salty grumpy! 

Thanks for not drinking with me today.",t3_o1mrno
24,Apologized to friends and thought I would feel better but I don’t?,"So about two weekends ago I went away for the weekend to visit friends and was a complete blackout drunk crying selfish mess. To top that off I also was unfaithful to my partner who I came clean to right away and he’s giving me another chance to clean up my act and change. I ghosted my friends after that weekend because I was an absolute emotional wreck and didn’t know what to even say to them. I felt embarrassed that I disrespected my partner and also that I ruined the wine tours etc for them all because I was a train wreck. I have known for a long time that I can’t drink and this was a giant wake up call. I finally messaged my friends today telling them how embarrassed I am and how sorry I am for everything. I explained that I have had bad mental health for a while now and have just hid it from them all so of course mixing alcohol wasn’t good and is never good for me. I felt like I needed to at least tell them how I felt to be able to move forward and heal regardless of it we are friends anymore or not. None of them have replied and I just feel horrible about it all. I thought reaching out would help me feel better but I just have anxiety now. Does anyone have any advice or have you been through a similar experience? 
I am so disgusted by myself for everything but also happy in a sense that something has finally happened that’s bad enough in my eyes to actually stop and make a change.

25,Is it possible (for some) to - just stop?,"I finally realized I'm an alcoholic and as I'm sure you're all aware: it's been a weird and very emotional few days (currently on my third day of sobriety). I tried quitting once in the past, lasted 2 months, but ultimately I didn't think I was an alcoholic then, I was just concerned about its mental effects.

I tried one AA meeting and wasn't a huge fan. To me personally, I think I have realized the severity of how dangerous liquor is to me, that I truly might never have it again. I had that with weed years ago, and only had two slips (while drunk, ironically).

I also think that if I do AA without trying to quit by myself, I'll never know if I quit because of AA or not. I've got some books I want to read, but besides that, I feel somewhat confident I can just stop.

Is it possible? Have you tried it? Is this my alcoholic brain talking, or my real brain talking?",t3_o1msm0
26,11 days and the guilt starts stacking,"It's hard to describe. After 11 days sober it's like my memory comes back. I remember all the terrible, embarrassing, aggressive, and intolerable behavior I put myself and others through as a drunk. It's stupid because these memories just make me want to drink to forget. The cycle is brutal. I'm trying to process it and own it. Wish I could forget all the pain. This is me reaching out for that support I suppose. Thanks.

27,Never learned how to cope without booze,"I'm almost 6 months sober, and almost can't believe it. 

I started drinking young, like a lot of teenagers in the UK, but once I hit 18 and went to university, I started to drink more. Not only socially or to party, but as an excuse and coping mechanism for everything. Nervous about exams? Drink. Shitty day? Drink. Shitty guys? Drink. Family drama? Drink. 

This was a continuous pattern for 13 years, which got a lot darker and worse in my last 3 years of drinking.

Since I have quit, I'm finding myself struggling to cope with things because I simply don't know how to. I'm overwhelmed with a lot of things right now (normal things like deadlines, classes, work) but I have a huge storm cloud looming over me with regards to my immigration situation and brexit. It's a complex thing to explain and don't fully want to get into, but in 6 months I may have to move back to the UK and leave my husband behind. The fact that I don't know what will happen and the idea of us having to live oceans apart is wearing down on me mentally.

The dark voice in my head keeps suggesting to have a drink, because that's all I know and have never learned how to face or deal with problems. Now I'm faced with such a huge issue that is pretty much out of my control and it's breaking me down to bits.

Weirdly it didn't seem that hard then, but each of those times I had an ""end"" date. There is something about this being ""forever"" that is absolutely making me feel panicked. Suddenly I am thinking about future vacations and feeling sad. I'm picturing my bachelorette party and wedding day and realizing I'll be sober. I'm realizing every single work event will be more annoying for me. Why does this ""indefinite"" thing feel so hard? How do I get over it and just focus on today?",t3_o1dypp
30,Day 3 and I almost stopped at the liquor store.,Went for a drive to get comfort food from my favourite Asian fusion restaurant and as I made my way I was hit with strong urges to stop at the liquor store. The back and fourth that goes on mentally. Racing thoughts of what’ll happen if I do. The moment of clarity hits me when I think about what I myself truly want.. I don’t want to drink anymore. I want a life I don’t want to escape from anymore. I don’t want to ruin myself anymore. I’m happy I didn’t stop at the liquor store.,t3_o1janf

36,Need some encouragement,"I’ll start by describing my past and present relationship with alcohol and sorry for the length of the post I just want to get it off my chest and need some encouragement to become sober again. I’ll add a tl;dr at the end. 

A lot of my family members are alcoholics so I grew up around people drinking and I’d spend the weekends with my dad in the pub when it was his turn to look after us. As I became a teenager I started drinking in parks with my friends on weekends and then once I became of legal age to drink it was off to the nightclubs, just a typical 18 year old.

Then in my mid twenties I was going through a rough patch at home and turned to drink to make myself feel better. The weekend only drinking became the odd night and eventually was every day but just a couple of beers. I managed to really cut down after about a year back to weekends only but never gave up completely. 

This went on for a while until about 4 years ago when my biggest problem started. I started drinking on the odd night of the week and then was back to everyday but this time it was a full six pack plus a couple of stronger beers. I’d hide the empties from my wife so she couldn’t tell how much I was drinking and I’d take cash out of the bank so she couldn’t see the transactions of me buying drink. She drinks spirits but very rarely, only special occasions so I’d swig out of the bottle and water it down so she couldn’t tell it was being drank. I’d then replace the bottle with a new one when it became too watered. I managed to hide my problem really well from everyone, even work colleagues when I’d go in feeling rough. 

I knew the problem was bad when I’d wake up and all day I couldn’t stop thinking about going to get my drink so I confided in my wife about what i’d been doing, it was real low point for me then. She was shocked and couldn’t believe it but was really supportive in my road to becoming sober, she deserved better. 

I managed to quit altogether for a year until I went back to the UK to visit family and it was back to the pub and the pull was too strong. It started with a couple drinks and ended up being weekends only for a long time. The year I spent sober was honestly the best year of my life.

Fast forward today and I’ve woke up hungover and drinking in the week again. I can feel those old habits coming back, I’m buying stronger and stronger beer and starting to want to hide my problem from my wife again. I’m going to talk to her today to help me again. I’ve been sober before so hopefully I can do it again.

If you took the time to read my post thank you, it means a lot.

tl;dr - had a problem with alcohol most of my life, managed to get sober before but can feel old habits coming back.",t3_o1l317
37,Bachelorette Party,"I am a month and a half sober and I have a bachelorette party coming up where I am one of the bridesmaids. I feel like this is my first major test. I want the bride-to-be to have fun and enjoy her day and I don't want anyone to focus on the fact that I am not drinking or harass me about it. 

The plan for the day is essentially champagne breakfast, pre-drinks, wine tour, pub. 

I don’t broadcast my sobriety because I find it easier to not have to explain myself and just fly under the radar, but I will very much be on the radar at this event. I grew up with a lot of the women going to this party and they know me as the party girl who is always down for a drink. 

I am feeling stressed about how to disclose the fact that I won’t be drinking, to me it seems like it shouldn’t matter but I am expecting to be questioned and I need advice on what I should answer.

I want to be strong and just say that I don't drink anymore, but I don't want to get into the finer details of why I have chosen to be sober. Best case scenario it is just left at that and we all have a great day, but I know the ladies going and I know that answer won't be sufficient and I don't want to make the trip awkward. My best friend (who knows about my sobriety but is not attending the bachelorette party) suggested I make up an excuse like I can't drink due to a medical reason, but I feel anxious about lying. I feel like this should be more simple but I am having anxiety about it. Should I message one of the bridesmaids I am staying with and tell her before the trip so it is not an issue on the day? Should I message the bride-to-be and warn her that I won't be drinking before the trip? Am I making an issue out of nothing? 

I thought about just not saying anything and on the day saying ""oh, I'm not drinking anymore"" in a polite way if I am offered an alcoholic drink, so that there is no prior speculation or bitchiness and I can just enjoy my soda water and lime all day. 

Reading this subreddit has really helped me so far in my sobriety journey so I thought I would turn to you guys for help.

Any advice is appreciated.",t3_o1i9nl
38,So I relapsed again,"Was on a 2 day bender, I've had something like 30-35 cans within then, yesterday I went through a twelve pack of White Claw and two tall boys.  My chest hurts even more now than ever.  My back hurts, I had the worst sleep.  Puked at 4am it's 8am now so I'm up now but so done with this unhealthy cycle. 

 I have no reason to complain about this pain if I'm just going to exacerbate it w/ alcohol.  I'm also hoping this is the final wake up call I'll get before this binge drinking ends up killing me.  Maybe it's heartburn or something more serious, idk, but what I do know is that I'm absolutely done with this poison- no matter if it distracts me in the moment, the cons greatly outweigh any ""pros"".  I just blow through a six pack around lunch hour, daytime drinking, then don't feel much then crave more.  So foolish of me.  I also take sleep medicine both prescription and OTC, so frustrating not being able to go back to sleep at 4 or 5am.  

Gonna go for a brisk walk/jog and try yet again.   Gonna try to get through today's impending anxiety without that so-called crutch.

39,Getting sober has completely changed my mindset about how I relate to food...,"After 16 years of heavy drinking that found me drinking a pint+ of vodka daily and almost losing my nursing license (incredibly grateful I didn’t hurt anyone and I still have my job/a nursing board disciplinary program that while horrible and archaic at least allowed me to keep my license) I finally got sober on Nov. 30, 2020.

I turned 30 in detox- hooray! 

Now that I’m almost 7 months into sobriety, among the other amazing things I’ve seen happening, I finally decided to DO something about the 50+ lbs that I’ve gained over the past decade.

I could never stick to any sort of healthy eating regiment because I thought I couldn’t do it- I’d get hungry and eventually give in to whatever I wanted to eat. I really didn’t have much faith my ability to maintain something long term (besides work and school, which I then did so much that I drove my mental health into the ground).

I started a weight loss program this weekend and have already noticed SUCH a difference in my motivation simply because I now have PRACTICE from sobriety in understanding that while I want something (drink, food, etc) the momentary gratification is worth less to me that the long term goal and my overall health. 


This might seem obvious but I think it finally clicked in my mind- I realized if I can get sober - and do all the work required to stay sober, I can certainly do other hard things too!

As an aside- Abstaining from alcohol is also a huge part of this particular weight-loss program and it feels nice for once to already be ahead of the curve on this aspect.

Just some thoughts- love this community.

IWNDWYT

ETA: I am learning that a lot of people aren’t familiar with the secular AA community and it’s awesome and growing and amazing.  Obviously whatever helps one get sober (whether through regular AA or something else entirely) is great, but just wanted to spread awareness of Secular/Agnostic AA and the awesome community.",t3_o19dus
40,60 days. - 1 realization,"Feeling amazing, getting in shape. 

Decided I’d give in with my buddies who were loaded for a dinner I attended. Felt like I deserved it. Painful to be around them while sober. All that happened is I realized I made a great decision. Being a hung over POS no longer serves me or my family. For a few hours I may or may not remember. Happy I got a chance to see that I wasn’t missing anything. Just a waste of time at this point in my life.

41,I think the girl at the petrol station is the first to notice,"Well I would be over at the gas station across the road maaybe 2-3 times a week or more buying wine or more wine should I say, I never used to buy the first bottle at the gas station because honestly the wine tastes like fucking rotten arse. 


But I'd definitely be there now buying my second bottle, potentially two, or maybe one big bottle and then one of the mini bottles (fucking pathetic really that my mind worked like this, always about having 'enough' but there was no such thing as 'enough')


I would dread going over there because of the judgement I perceived from the girl at the station, really I was the one judging myself. I was messy, ugly, mean, no pride in my appearance I just wanted that fucking wine and I didn't want the human interaction. 


Anyway tonight I wen't over for cigarettes, I haven't been there this late in a while. I think she thought I was looking for the wine. But when I went straight to the counter she just smiled at me like she usually didn't. I think she noticed. I definitely was a more nice and normal person to her and didn't look awful. So whether she noticed or not, it was a win for me. Feels great going to the petrol station, well not great definitely shame free.


I also had intended on getting a snack but I forgot lol. I'm not going back, cbfd...Usually I could go twice in one night for wine. 


Have a great day friends! IWNDWYT

My sister said she'd make tiramisu for us (3 sisters and dad) for dinner tomorrow night, it's a family favourite. I asked if she could make me an AF portion almost without thinking and she said omg yes of course, no big deal. I could have cried. I want to just drink and drink and drink until this pain goes away but I will not. I will not touch it. I know everything would be so much worse if I did and the thought of worse is too much to bear, I want to be sick.

43,Apple Cider Vinegar - my strange treat to myself,"Strange, but I’ve always loved it. I think I have always had an affinity for acidic tasting things. Now, instead of a glass of an alcoholic beverage (which is never just one glass) I am relaxing in a bath sipping on a teeny tiny glass of apple cider vinegar. Has anyone else ever done this or am I just a very strange person?! :)

A while back a friend told me how to make “fire cider” which was (from what I recall) Apple Cider Vinegar, garlic, chili pepper and horse radish.

Now that my wellness means more to me now, I am wanting to try making “fire cider” again. Has anyone else made it or have a recipe?",t3_o1k44m

I just finished reading ""This Naked Mind"" it was an eye opener for sure and has definitely left me feeling more peaceful and resolved in my decision to quit marijuana and alcohol. 

I am just shy of three weeks clean after a pretty horrible detox that landed me in the emergency room for a night. (Please reach out for help if you are quitting).
I was a so called ""functioning alcoholic"" outwardly anyway but internally I was a just an empty shell.

I just wanted to say hi and thanks for having me. 
I have been lurking this sub for a couple years reading posts and absorbing information. Sometimes I would sit here drunk off my ass just scrolling and scrolling. Hoping and pleading to find the strength to quit. Something finally clicked and I just said enough. I'm either going to give into these suicidal thoughts or I am going to get better. So this is my first time posting. Mostly for my own accountability. But also in the Hope's someone else who is struggling might read this and know they can give themselves the permission to stop aswell. 

I also just finished reading ""The power of now"" by eckhart tolle. And found one quote in particular quite helpful. It's the title of my post.

The worst moment was today when I brought my son to a drive through for fast food.  
I ordered, paid and then just drove away!  I drove right past the food window and went to drive home. It wasn’t until I got to the exit when I realized what happened.

I've always been a bad drunk and an alcoholic but I didn't truly accept it til eight years later, it runs in my family, my parents literally met in AA. I have a really long and crazy story but I'll save it.

I feel really silly for just quitting now and being in denial this long. Been avoiding going out cuz alcohol is literally EVERYWHERE and my alcoholic friend just hmu to hang out and i'm tempted to say yes, ugh. I'm not going to but it's bizarre realizing how normalized and just everywhere it is. Was at the pool yesterday and the smell of beer in the air made me sick.

47,Moderating my consumption…,"Let me begin by saying I used to have a good relationship with alcohol. Not great, but good. 

I am confident.

I laugh.

I’m fun to be around.

I talk to everyone.

I always bring over girls to my group to help everyone have a good time.

But lately, I have become very aggressive with my drinking. I don’t drink everyday - maybe 3 days a week at the very most. But now when I do, I go over the top. I stay up late, continuing to drink. I call, message, and FaceTime numerous people until 3-4AM, which has disturbed some and humored others. 

But that’s not me. I am not the guy that wants to be known for that. But alas, here I am.

Finally there was a night where the straw broke the camel’s back. One of my closest neighbors, cute girl in her early 30’s who hangs out with me and my friends every week, finally confronted me. She felt.. scared around me. Just typing that makes my eyes tear up. 

That has never been who I am.

Or is she just the only person to tell me that? 

I drink with my family, my parents, my closest friends, random people, you name it. I have never been told once that I am anything close to that. I have always been told that I am fun to be around but never anything *that* hurtful. 

As I said, I don’t drink everyday but when I do, I need to moderate. 

I need to know when to cut myself off. When to call it a night, go upstairs, and get away from my phone so that I can sober up.

This is becoming a rant and was not my intention but I needed to get it out and written down somewhere other than my personal notebook.

I’ve always known i’ve needed to try therapy, but always made excuses. A big excuse was the cost. Did some math, the price to spend for therapy monthly would be around what I would spend on alcohol. Funny how that works. It’s time to reinvest.",t3_o1k20k
49,I had my last drink on the other side of the sun.,"182.5 days, 1/2 year.  What started out as a 30-day sobriety trial, ended up revealing that I actually had an alcohol dependency.  

I'd probably been working towards that for my whole adult life but pretty sure I crossed a line last year, without really knowing it.  Likely due to a combination of the ""fancy booze as an upscale hobby"" trap coupled with pandemic boredom and frustrations.

Anyway I was surprised when I tried to stop, since I was hit with cravings for alcohol that I'd never really experienced before.  Like I'd catch myself thinking ""Hey doesn't a whiskey sound good right now?"" and then five minutes later ""Yeah, what about that whiskey?""  Followed by ""Maybe just a few beers, then, that sounds good too.""  I even had the ""booze dreams"" where I'd wake up almost tasting it.  No bueno.

I was surprised by these not-so-subtle preoccupations which I'd never noticed before.  Thoughts about how maybe I could break my never-before-5pm rule ""just this once"", or since I was drinking fine scotch/bourbon that I was just a ""connoisseur"" so having a few extra glasses per night was perfectly fine. 

Anyway for those who were like me, thinking maybe they have an issue but aren't sure, just do an alcohol-free trial and see how it goes.  In the past I'd been ok, but this time not so much.  I discovered something relatively early which I now feel would have continued to escalate had I not stopped.  Thanks SD, IWNDWYT.",t3_o1aege
50,Thankful and awestruck,"Since I started my journey towards sobriety I have been humbled, amazed, awestruck, and quite frankly, shocked by the people in life and communities (r/stopdrinking, and AA) outpouring of support. It has really restored my faith in humanity. I thought that I would be shunned or ostracized from my friends. I was completely wrong. They told me how proud they were of me, and that they had my back 100%. Same with family and even my job. 

I went to my first AA meeting yesterday. I am sure it's not for everyone, and I'm not here to endorse AA, but I couldn't have had a better experience. 2 gentleman from the meeting already called me today to check up on me and see how I was doing. Amazing!

This community has been invaluable. The stories and struggles are so different yet so much the same. I have been in a outpatient rehab program and they ask us everyday what we are grateful for. Today r/stodrinking was on my list.

I am not good with feeling anger. So I really wanted to come back here, where I am alone now, and drink. But i ate cake and am having seltzer and a good cry. 

This sub helps remind me why a drink isnt worth it. Thank you.",t3_o1f7ni
52,Day 2 and just realizing I have a problem,"Today is the day where it finally has dawned me completely that my drinking is problematic. I don’t drink everyday or binge drink everyday. But when I have one drink I can’t stop and keep going until I go to bed.

It’s destroying my relationship. I’ve been seeing a woman I’ve known for years and I’m head over heels in love with. We have had maybe 5 altercations in the official 6 months we have been seeing each other and all of them were due to me being too intoxicated and I can’t control my emotions and insecurities. It’s pushing her away and I can’t allow myself to continue being this way.

Over the last few months since I completely stopped smoking weed in December and stopped tobacco (on and off), I have been drinking increasingly more. It used to be like a once a week heavy binge drink but since mid April it has been 1-5 drinks daily 5 days/week and on some days way more. Those are the days where I’m having meltdowns and destroying the good things in my life. The things I’ve worked hard for. 

I have always struggled to stop by thinking like how I’ll miss out on social scenarios and how I won’t be fun to be around if I’m not drinking too. But it’s dawning on me that I’m already not fun to be around when I’m drinking when I drink too much and treat my partner differently due to my emotions. 

Recently it has gotten bad and I drank a bunch and blacked out and got into a massive fight with my partner that was so irrational and I didn’t even remember a single thing I said during it or even an hour later.

I need to stop because it’s escalating and I’m spiraling. I want control of my life and to be the best version of myself. I care a lot about fitness and I’m negating all gains by drinking this way as well. I’m now skipping workouts because I just want to get the point of the day where I can start drinking.

That’s all I’m going to say for now, except if you want to do it - just do it. Work at it, struggle, but do it. Because you can.

For my part, my brain feels different and my consciousness seems….dare I say….MORE psychedelic? MORE transcendent? More present and aware of the varied levels of existence and consciousness that we experience second to second? I’m coming out of my sedation…

I could say that. But I’ll just say thanks to people here posting and typing, even if you think I you are failing - you’re still the brave ones.",t3_o18fxa

55,Feeling really close to a relapse today,"I dont know what it is. The past few days have been really good. I've been so happy and grateful for my sobriety. But today... maybe I'm tired, or it's because it's cold. Maybe wanting to drink is some weird pavlovian response to snow. Maybe it's the good ol imposters syndrome kicking my butt again.

I've filled my stomach so I'm not actually going to drink. With a full belly I wouldn't even get drunk anyway so theres no point. But I just *really* want to check out and vegetate. Letting go of my senses and numbing myself really sounds good right now.

I'm gonna try and relax, play some video games and watch crap tv. Everything i would do if i was drunk/high. I'm just gonna do it sober, and it's going to have the same effect (hopefully). 

I need to remember why i wanted to be sober in the first place. Using substances doesn't help, it doesn't make me feel better. *It doesnt*. And it's not worth sacrificing all of my progress now. 

It's just hard because I'm half a week over my previous record. Getting sober for me has looked like longer and longer stints of abstinence with shorter and shorter relapses in between. So my addict brain is rationalizing ""having some today isnt so bad, you've made progress since last time, you can let go today, you dont have to white knuckle it."" And it's almost working because I *have* made progress and I *dont* want to white knuckle my way through life. It's taking grains of truth and twisting them against me. And I'm almost letting it.

Goddammit I'm so tempted. But I'm gonna try to not drink with you tonight. Might update with an IWNDWYT later if successful.",t3_o1fn5g

Some things I've noticed recently:

1. I'm lonely and going a little stir crazy, but it's getting better every day. I do a lot of pacing and sometimes shower multiple times a day out of boredom.
1. I'm learning to exist with myself again. I rediscovered reading and really like it. 
1. I'm eating a lot better. I no longer feel bloated and lethargic all day long. My poop is solid again. 
1. I started exercising a bit and am really looking forward to getting stronger. 
1. My sleep has improved a TON, and is still improving as time goes on.  
1. I wish it wasn't so hot outside so I could wander more.
1. Eating alone in a restaurant is liberating.
1. Work is starting to become enjoyable again.

A lot of my complaints in sobriety (being lonely and bored) were there while I was drinking as well. The difference is now I am not actively pushing people away by being a drunken asshole, so I got that going for me.

My body is aching so bad and I’ve had a headache all day. The longest I’ve gone in the last year and a half without drinking was 6 days but that was months ago. I can’t control myself when I drink. There is no such thing as one glass of wine for me it will always be the whole bottle in one sitting and god help me if there’s any more alcohol in the house after that. I’ve been depressed and stressed for so long and it always felt like alcohol would give me that small moment of joy for a while but lately I don’t get any joy out of it but it’s the only thing that makes all the noise go away. It’s also the root of everything negative in my life. I’ve gained 40 lbs since March of last year and I’m so mad at myself. I told myself to try and make it one week bur I’m only on day 3 and feel like giving in and it’s beyond discouraging. I’m going to be 30 in less than 2 weeks and I feel like I’m 50.

59,Day 3 check in,"2 days sober and already feeling much better about myself and my life. I read the 5 AM Club and decided to wake up at 5am and hit the gym then the stream room. Afterwards, I took my dog on a 2 mile walk. It was my daily routine when I was sober for 2 years, but drinking when you get off work until 2-3 am doesn't lend itself well to waking up at 5 and doing anything but puking.

I know at some point, I'll get the itch/urge to drink and I want to be prepared for it this time. I know I can't control myself once I start and I truly believe just checking in every day is doing wonders to keep me motivated long enough to cement my habits in strong enough to override any of those urges that will come sooner or later.

It scared me because I have recently felt like my life is spiralling away from me and I’m losing control because of alcohol. I know that i need to get my life under control and to do that I need to quit drinking. I know I can’t be a “just one or two drinks” person but I am done lying to myself and believing I can not address this. I don’t want my life to be shitty because of my alcoholism.

Get handed a list of alcohol. Fairs and events? Alcohol. No wonder in 2019 there were 14.5 MILLION people dealing with alcohol use disorder, it is EVERYWHERE. I can’t watch tv without all these glamorized ads about alcohol showing how much fun it is and how sexy it is. I can’t go to the grocery store and buy seltzer without passing by it. It feels impossible today, it feels like everywhere I look it’s there and today I feel like giving up. End rant.",t3_o19zeh
64,The Let’s Be Bad Spousal Convo,"So it’s day 2. My lady doesn’t ever really grasp that I’m actually trying to stay away from drinking. It’s because she doesn’t have a problem and I’ve “quit” many times before. She tries to be good for her health and is more of a sugar junkie. This “week” she’s being “good”. 

I’m outside watering the garden and she does a big groan, “Ohhh, I’m struggling...”. 

So I put down my hose and went inside. This is because the follow up is talking about how much she wants alcohol or dessert. 

She seemed to understand and wasn’t bitter. Anyone else have this enabler issue? How do you deal with it?",t3_o1gayj
65,Day 2 and frustrated with myself,"Day 2 again--

I was almost at 30 days sober for the first time in years, and I gave myself a pass to drink at a memorial celebration for a close friend that I lost about 6 weeks ago. I overdid it, made some seriously regrettable choices, and now I'm dealing with the consequences. I'm angry that my friend is gone. I'm angry that I allowed myself to drink. I'm angry that I couldn't just ""have a couple drinks,"" but instead got blacked out and made a fool of myself. Don't really have anyone to share this with, so I thought I'd post here since you guys have surely felt something similar. Trying to be gentle with myself and keep an eye on the positives moving forward. I will not drink with you today.",t3_o1d59c
66,tried alcohol free beer MIXED and now im very nauseous,"Hey ho buddies, almost 9 months sober and used to enjoy beer immensely but i just accidentally drank 200 milliliters of lemonade mixed with alcohol free beer (its a very popular beverage here in Germany but i thought the bottle was just lemonade at first) and it did NOT go down smoothly.

Im fine, it triggered a medium craving but i can deal with those at this point. But i've been feeling like i need to puke for almost half an hour now. 

I just wanted to ask if any of you had an experience similar to mine when you tried alcohol free beer or wine, or even when you drank some real booze?

Had stayed clear of these drinks until now and decided after the first sip to try it further but i ended up dumping the rest in the drain. So suffice to say i will continue avoiding them at all costs 😁",t3_o1fops
67,50 days,Today marks 50 days for me. This has been the longest I have made it sober for long time. It’s been much easier this go because of the support of this group. Anytime I have had an urge to have drink I come here and read and remember why I’m doing this in the first place. Just wanted to say thank you and I really appreciate each and everyone of you.,t3_o19279
68,Detox was A gamechanger for me,"Checked myself into detox
Shouldn’t be too hard to find or get into one 

Just here to let you guys know it was a game changer for me 

I was getting the “shakes” and didn’t even know it, extreme anxiety,panic.

Was also coming off 2 substances, I was just more dependent on the alcohol than I thought 

Never wanna feel like that again 

Stopped lying to myself n checked myself in 

Was there for 3-4 days and I’m 8 days sober now

69,Day 10 today,"I’m struggling right now with cravings. I want that escape. Opened a sparkling water instead. It’s a beautiful day out and usually I’d love nothing more than to both drink and smoke weed, but I’m journaling instead. IWNDWYT",t3_o1fat5
70,Back on the wagon,"I’ve sobered up for a few days hundreds of time. Made it a month a handful of times. Made it three of four a few times. Made it six months last year. Make the same idiotic mistake every time. Had a foolish moment, got drunk, and then sobered up again for a month. Told myself, “That was no problem. Maybe I can moderate now!”

Flash forward three months and I’m drinking at 9:00am. Empty liquor bottles in my desk drawer and closet. Miserable and feeling absolute contempt for myself. Well, of course that’s what happens. I’m an alcoholic and the notion that I will ever be able to moderate is the most epic bit of willful self-delusion I can fathom.

Just don’t. Just don’t! If you quit drinking, you did it for a reason, and that reason wasn’t because you were managing things just fine and everything was cool.

“If I could drink in moderation, I’d do it all the time!”

Yup. Day four again. IWNDWYT.",t3_o13m7h
71,What's up Wednesday?! My life is up from not drinking!,So excited to enjoy the rest of this day. Dare I say I got to much sleep last night? I I didn't know that was possible but I guess it's easy to sleep with out booze. Enjoy your day friends!,t3_o185nh
72,Finally opened up to my wife,"Over the past 3 years my wife has seen me spiral downhill. She knew I drank, but I did everything I could to hide the depth of it. She found 2-3 beer cans in the recycling bin each day, but she didn't see the other cans, wine bottles, and 750ml bottles I hid around the house. The worst part is I hid these because she loves me, since if she found any more she would reprimand me because I was drinking too much. But I was selfish and didn't want to be bothered.

She tried to help me even more after I went to the hospital last year because I was throwing up blood. I still didn't admit to her how much I was drinking. Made it a week sober after the the hospital, and I was right back at it again. Told her I felt fine, and I could drink in moderation. Granted, I believed this too. Over the past year she thought I would drink on the weekends, maybe on a weekday once or twice... Last week I was drinking a 750ml bottle a day. After throwing up blood again on Saturday, I realized I had to stop or I wouldn't be her husband for much longer.

I was so scared yesterday, but we sat down and I finally admitted how bad it was. How I lied about the amount I was drinking. How she always had to do first shift driving on long trips because I was too hungover. How I wasn't going to bed early to feel rested, but because I was passing out. It was surreal. One of those moments that feels almost out of body. Every word of truth I told her was a weight being lifted off.

I was taken aback by her level of support, especially after all of the deceit. I deserved hate, but got love. Unlike a year ago, I actually want to stop this time. Having the depth of the situation in the open, and finally admitting to it, makes it already feel easier. I look forward to a long, healthy life with her. 

My wife and I will not drink with you today.",t3_o0qiby
73,"3 days on 3 days off...Wash, rinse, repeat. I'm 3 days off currently and super depressed","Hello all, been a lurker and now a new poster here in this sub. So I've been a drinker for 22 years. My drinking has escalated presently from weekend social gatherings to 3 day benders. 

This past weekend I hit a low by excessive drinking from Friday to Sunday (at my friends wedding weekend oof!) Monday was pure hell with swirling thoughts of doom - ""wtf did I do wrong"", ""I hope I wasn't an ass"", ""How did others perceive me"", ""Did I disappoint my good bud"" etc. Apparently I had did nothing wrong as I had to enquire with other friends from the wedding the following day...but still. From my own third person POV I felt like I had done something wrong as I tend to self-criticize often.  

I've been doing the 3 day benders a lot more often; and it's one of those 3 days on, 3 days off type of things. Once I feel ""repaired"" after the third day it's time to start hitting the bottle soon type of mentality. Mind you I do this maybe once or twice a month depending on the situation. So it's not an every single day of the month drinking problem, but it sure is a drinking problem in it's own right. 

So currently this is my 3rd day sober and I'm having a real difficult time with my mental health. I'm so depressed that I forced myself to sleep longer today when I really didn't need the extra sleep. I'm still ruminating thru thoughts of the wedding in my mind and I'm just plain tired of feeling like this. I used to be active physically now I could care less about exercise and other activities. I'm just plain jaded with life and unmotivated. 

It's close to summer time and this is my favorite time of the year and yet I'm stuck inside my home just horribly miserable, wishing I wasn't me. I need to break free, I need motivation, I need my sanity back. I really don't have much more to add to this post, but this was something I needed to get off my chest instead of holding it in and being worse off. I'd appreciate thoughts, suggestions and identifiable persons out there struggling with the heaviness of alcohol addiction and depression. Be well all.",t3_o1f5sw
74,One week,"I made it to a week this morning. Been a long time since that’s happened!
Thought I messed up (stupid dream) but here we are, one week better than last. Thanks y’all for being here.
Side note~never had that dream before. While it was very not pleasant, I feel like it’s a good dream because it shows me I’m taking this seriously for once. Y’all are the best, wouldn’t have made it without this community. I’m happy to be here and I will not drink again with y’all today.",t3_o1805q
75,Anxious,"Spent all night pacing round the house, anxious to see if I’ve still got a job by the end of tomorrow after my latest escapade on Monday.I’ve been warned before but I didn’t learn. Alcohol can literally destroy everything good in a persons life.",t3_o1mg3q
76,"Day 1 again, worst I’ve ever felt","The anxiety is killing me. I have this knot of dread writhing around in the pit of my stomach. And I’m shaking and twitching. I am scared I’ll never feel better again.

I’m looking for reassurance that it’ll get better, I’m having a bit of a panic attack",t3_o19l0d
77,I got 4 years this month and I got something I wanna say.,"I slipped up a year ago and relapsed for 36 hours. And if I was in AA I would've been told to relinquish chips and start all over again. 

Fuck. That.

(This isn't a fuck AA post, just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it doesn't work for other people. Whatever you need to keep you from drinking is what you need, ain't my place to judge)

I worked hard AF to get to 3 years. I learned a lot about myself. I managed to stay sober working in bar/restaurants as a dishwasher and working my way up to line cook surrounded by people with drug/drinking problems. And to feel like I should negate ALL THAT WORK AND TIME over a lapse in judgement is fucking bullshit.

I'm not saying everyone can go out and do whatever they want without consequence. I'm not saying everyone can go out and get crazy every couple years as a treat. I'm not saying any of that. What I'm saying is that to err is human. Every one makes mistakes. Don't be so fucking hard on yourselves. I learned a lot in those 36 hours. Mostly, the booze doesn't fuckin help at all. It makes things a lot worse. There are no solutions at the bottom of a bottle. None. Just fucking anxiety, poor decisions, and despair.

I dunno man, I just been thinking a lot and wanted to put this out there for anyone who might benefit from it. Nobody's perfect, and admitting faults is a big part of sobriety. I fucked up, but I don't feel like tripping, falling in the mud, picking myself back up, and dusting myself off negates the hundreds of miles I walked without trippin. I didn't wallow in that mud pile for a week or a month.

I still have bad days, woke up from a dream the other day where I snuck some beers out the work fridge and drank them on the way home. But I listened to the album that started me on my journey of sobriety, Eminem- Relapse, and it helped put shit into perspective again. Some days it's easy and you don't even think about it, some days you wake up from nightmares like [this](https://youtu.be/94JmRMOH83k).

I dunno man, I'm just ranting. Good luck everyone and IWNDWYT (cept these delicious non-alcoholic clausthaler 😋)",t3_o0w8jg
78,Day 1,"I have been so in denial about my addiction. I can function, sometimes I might even go a week without a drink and think that's evidence enough I don't have a problem. But I do have a problem, I wake up and think about when it's an acceptable time to start drinking, I think about how much I can drink without it becoming obvious to the people around me. I could easily finish a bottle of wine and not appear visibly drunk (I think I just built up a tolerance because years ago a bottle would have floored me), so I would hide it in my drawers so my SO wouldn't have to see an empty bottle and start asking questions. I plan my social life around when I can drink. It is a problem. 

This last week alone I have been drunk 5 out of 7 days. Yesterday I drank a bottle and a half of wine before 5pm. I hid the rest of the bottle so my SO wouldn't find it. It worries me that my tolerance has built up, I'm too young to have health issues related to alcohol. 

I hate the anxiety that I have when I'm sober, I hate the overwhelming feeling that I'm a failure and generally bad at life.  I don't want to be this person. 

I poured the last of wine down the sink today. My hands have been trembling all day I think because of the withdrawals? It's not too bad but definitely noticeable. I keep on telling myself that I could be a social drinker and just not drink when I'm at home but tbh I don't think that would work. I'm a very all or nothing person. And I know now with alcohol it needs to be nothing. I don't want to let it get to the stage where it's ruining my relationships and my work life. I deserve to treat myself and those I love with more respect than I am showing them at the moment. 

So today is my day 1. I think the hardest part will be when I'm out - saying no will be difficult. But I'm going to try my best. I really want to be better.",t3_o17dbb
79,Day 1 again,"Last night, a Tuesday, despite previously only drinking on weekends and mostly wine, agreed to try a shot of rum over the back fence from my neighbor who said she collects rum varieties from vacation destinations. Immediately regretted it, didn’t even get that “high” of boozy delight I thought it would give me and now back to day 1. Not beating myself up though, it’ll make the guilt worse. Releasing the shame and committing to do better for today. ETA: I did have over 2 weeks sober before and it wasn’t hard, I know I can get there again. IWNDWYT.",t3_o1av1i
80,Finally Deciding to Stop,"Hi everyone,

I'm 36. I've drank heavily since 18. Half my life. I'm tired of wrecking my health and my wallet. So no more. I'm two days sober now. Excited to get to 5 days, and then double digits.

81,Today’s day 1,I can lie to myself better than anyone. I’m tired of the damage I can do. I got out of work yesterday and decided I wanted to drink and paint while I watch a movie before my wife got home. I buy extra wine so I can top off and make it look like I’m still on glass number 1. The only thing I remember from last night is that I threw up in the computer room. I woke up this morning on the couch. My wife knows about my problem. Idk why she doesn’t leave me. My drinking really started in college in art school. I’d drink to complete my projects. Now I only can create art while I drink. I only get creative urges while I drink. And the problem is I don’t go down. I can finish off three bottles of wine if I wanted to. And a week later I can convince myself that I’m fine and can handle it. My routine usually is wait till she’s asleep and go down stairs throw a movie on and continue painting and drinking. I usually remember most of the night. But I completely blacked out. I woke up on the couch. I’ve been in this situation a thousand times but today I’m truly ashamed and embarrassed. I have a fucking kid on the way and I can’t keep it together. I’m at work waiting for my wife to text me back. I’m at a point too where I don’t even like the taste of any alcohol but I just keep doing it for the feeling. I can’t live this life anymore. I’m subliminally killing myself. Today is day 1.,t3_o141og
82,The re-opening/lifting pandemic restrictions is my biggest challenge of all,"I've been feeling ""off"" for the past few weeks and not in the best headspace. The re-opening and people letting loose like there is no more variants of Covid. I went to a wedding this past weekend and spent no less than 15 minutes staring down the bar because I had the urge to get blackout drunk. Similar to drinking a 40oz in ten minutes and letting everything go.

Instead I finally tore myself away and went to the opposite side but even today still feel some of the urge. I feel like I'm the only one who is not celebrating the restrictions being lifted because something else is going to happen and I just want to hide and drink away the thoughts.

Not that I'm going to because I know the results will be disastrous and just trying to keep up with things sober is a hard enough challenge.

83,Sober but still an addict.,"Given up on the mind and spirit crushing drug alcohol, but still find myself looking for that dopamine rush in other things. 

While certainly less damaging, impulse buying stuff online isn't healthy for the bank account, and it hardly nourishes the soul beyond that moment I click ""buy"". Even getting the stuff in the mail ultimately is bland.

It goes for other things too.. has anyone experienced similar and moved beyond it?",t3_o18zhu
84,I never thought I’d actually have a post for this sub,"I’ve been lurking for months but not had any kind of success to tell. Yesterday’s was so incredibly minor but I think it’s going to be hugely important long term…

…I went to the pub yesterday, and had a pint of water. Just water. That was it.

And I still enjoyed myself, I didn’t get tired and want to leave before the drinkers, someone even commented on how giggly I was that evening, and all that merriment was not at all compromised by not drinking.

I’ve had it in my mind for a long time that, yes it’d be healthier, but it’d be less fun. Never been happier in my life to be proven wrong!

I’m looking to control drinking rather than stop it all together but yesterday was such a breakthrough that it’s the first time in a while I’ve thought it possible. Yay!",t3_o0znvb
85,Day one. I’m in hell and I have to stop.,"I have no choice anymore. I have lost everything. My partner, my stepdaughter, my community, my family. I have found myself completely isolated and alone. This happened a month ago, the worst part is they’re all still partying and having a great life together, with him and his new girlfriend who popped into the tribe 3 days after we split up for good. And I have to still live there and witness this because I have no friends and nowhere to go. I am in so much emotional pain. 

My higher power is telling me the only way out of this hell I feel is to stop drinking. It’s the only step I can take. I’ve also started antidepressants and anxiety meds, but I’ve still been drinking daily. 

My alcoholism has hurt everyone I love and cost me everything.

86,Post Pandemic Sobriety,"Hi all,

I just wanted to come on here to vent a little bit. I’ve been sober a little over 7 months, basically only through the pandemic. It was a lot easier when people weren’t going out a whole lot. Now, my state has lifted restrictions on social distancing and masks. This means going out to bars, parties, clubs, events etc. In the last week I had my birthday, a party, and an event, offers to go out dancing etc. While I’m really pleased with my sobriety, I can’t help but feel a little uncomfortable in these situations without drinking. I feel my social anxiety, shyness, awkwardness, etc coming to the surface and In situations where I’d usually be drinking. Has anyone else experienced this and have any tips on how to feel more at ease?",t3_o1ky51
87,I've got the bumwees today,"But not from alcohol, win 1 of today. It was from mega dentist anxiety.
 
Win 2 was finally heading to the dentist for the first time since my last long patch of sobriety. I did not enjoy the scraping, but my teeth are still ok &amp; now super clean. *squeaks teeth* 
 
That was one of those big deal things I've been putting off. So I'm glad that's done... despite getting sunburn on my legs through the window.

90,Sleeping after quitting.,I was able to string a week together here recently where I didn’t drink or smoke. I slept like shit the entire time. I was lifting weights in the morning and doing a 30 minute sauna work out in the evenings. But I could not fall asleep until 3am or later and only slept for 30 minutes at a time. No deep sleep just sweats and bad dreams. How long has this lasted for some of you? I relapsed Saturday and ran it into Sunday. Chained smoked the entire time and now I am sick as a dog. Trying to avoid sleeping aids. I have some GABA which I understand to be a natural relaxant. Just looks to see what others have experienced.,t3_o1i4tc
91,Had to (temporarily) delete my social medias today,"I've struggled ever since I stopped drinking last August with alcohol ads in my news feeds. I finally was able to edit my Google and Facebook ad settings so that almost none of my ads are alcohol-related.  

However, here in Ontario, it's patio season again as restaurants/bars are now allowed to have people on their patios again. The sudden influx of people posting ""first drink of patio season!"" and just posting pictures of their pints in general has triggered the FOMO part of my addiction these last few days. Today I decided that I didn't want to look at any of it anymore, and disabled Facebook, Instagram, and deleted Snapchat.  

I realize that it's unrealistic and silly to expect people to just not post about their lives, and to expect everyone to bend their lives around my problem, but what I CAN control is whether or not I see it.  

If anyone has any advice on how to deal with seeing alcohol everywhere and learning to ignore it, I'm all ears. I haven't seen any professional help over the course of my recovery so I have no idea how to cope with having to ignore temptation and FOMO.  

Much peace and love, IWNDWYT.",t3_o18vkd
92,One week: what worked,"Just made it a week for first time in months..

Here's what worked for me...

1- Being lazy. I know exercise is good for you and I intend to ramp it up in coming weeks but I sat around and did a whole lot of nothing and let my body recover. Got my 10k steps in each day but beyond that I was blissfully lazy.

2- CBD/THC edibles. This helped me sleep and keep anxiety/depression at bay while not going back to smoking 

3- Ate/Drank healthy. Didn't indulge in bad food/sugar drinks etc. I enjoyed some treats but fought the urge to eat  bacon cheeseburgers and sodas everyday. Healthy lifestyle choices leading to other healthy choices. Gaining some momentum and it feels great.

4-  Reading. This may trigger some but reading about recovery is great but also about debaucherous drunken drugged out behavior has helped too. Currently reading ""Nothin' but A Good Time"" about the 80s hair metal explosion in LA. It is hilarious but also a cautionary tale. A lot of those guys didn't survive or became sober. Been reflecting a lot on my own lost years and how insane life was at times.

5- Posting here and in other recovery communities on Reddit. You guys are the best. So supportive and full of love. Posting here helps tremendously with accountability. I know I can be open and honest. Writing stuff down is huge for me.

6- Therapy. Obvious one but finally found the right therapist and it has been huge. After countless attempts at sobriety without professional help, this time feels totally different.

Thanks for reading! Have a great day. Off for a hike with my family. Iwndwyt",t3_o19o8d

Turns out it meant a lot to me. Im sitting in bed past noon feeling worse than my worst hangover ever was. I betrayed myself, my wifes trust, and my friends who have all been so supportive of me. 
Im just having trouble feeling anything but negative. And i should be happy! I just started a job,ive got classes lined up in the fall to go back to school, all because i began this sobriety. So why did i spit in the face of all of this?

Now during my downtime I have to listen to the people around me and I realize I have nothing in common with them and I’m back to crushing loneliness.

96,I hate myself so much - but I am committing to change today,"It's day 1 - yet again. Been drinking every night since the weekend. It's that cycle where you go crazy the first time and then the withdrawals are so bad you tell yourself you need to ""taper it off"" to reduce the brutality. But that didn't work this time, have felt like garbage every single day and finally decided to stop before I get fired from being so tired and shaky that I can barely do my job. It's so depressing because I thought this cycle of insanity was over, I can't believe I've done this again. 

I can't wait to get to day 5 again - and beyond, oh my god. That feeling when your fried central nervous system begins to reset to like a normal person. I've finally decided to just face the fact that if I start, this will always happen so I'm just going to stop for good. It's going to suck having feelings again but...I don't think anything can suck more than this burned out nightmare feeling.

Reading this forum is the only thing that stops me going completely insane. Knowing that I'm not alone, and that other people have been where I am and made it out. I'm posting today partly because it just reduces the feeling of panic, and also because it's time to take some accountability. And also just to say a massive thank you to everyone that posts here, your stories have helped me more than I can say. 

I'm off out to try and walk off the shakes, I'm hoping exercise will partially reduce the terror...

I will not drink today. I will learn to face life sober and be a better human being.",t3_o1a0yq
97,532 Days - Applied For (and Got?) A Second Job 🎉🎉🎉,"Hi, Everyone! I hope all of you are doing good! 

Things are ok on this end. I went on a job interview yesterday morning, and got that lined up (I joked to my friend because, while the boss didn't officially say ""You're Hired"" he did give me a list of new hire information to email, including my direct deposit info, etc. so I said well, I either got the job, or this guy's gonna scam me and go on some Amazon shopping spree haha : ) Well, so that's good. It's just gonna be a little part time thing, in a restaurant, so that I can hopefully phase out of my current job (customer service/financial services at a big box store). Where I am now, I've been there about 6 months, and I'm actually pretty proud of it because it is my only non-restaurant job I've ever had (I had to because of the restaurant closures) and now I do all these big financial transactions, like for thousands of dollars. It's crazy to me that I do this now. At the same time, it's really, really stressful. I also really dislike the new manager that started a couple of weeks ago. 

We had a situation a couple of weeks ago at work where, to make a long story short - I was basically made to do this transaction that I wasn't comfortable with. The people in charge called my manager at home to get his approval for this (which was super weird and has never happened before) which he gave, and then I had to do it even though I've had to watch entire training videos about never doing this. It was a refund for $150, which literally means nothing to this company, but I was more bothered because I kept saying like ""I'm not comfortable doing this"" ""I don't think this is right. We shouldn't do it"" but like 3 other people in charge were next to me saying ""Just do it"". I know it's not money out of my pocket or anything, but outside of my sobriety, the things that I've been working on most are setting boundaries and having more confidence in myself. I had a lot of (daily, constant) mental and emotional abuse growing up, and later, physical abuse, and it has taken me a lot to get to the point where I can at least speak up sometimes. So, to have that kinda written off (not kinda, totally) it really made me mad, and it made me mad at myself that I caved in the end, and didn't just say ""No"" even though I thought that might be considered insubordination. 

At any rate - my sobriety has been teaching me a lot in terms of showing me that 1) I can change things that I'm unhappy with and 2) I am a tough person, that has not only the ability, but the right, to speak up for myself. So, I applied for this second job, that I'm hoping will eventually become my only job. IWNDWYT",t3_o19vwj
98,Has anyone gotten to the point where you truly lost everything?,"I have lost everything. I have no biological family. I have lost the family I was welcomed into. The love of my life, a stepdaughter, a huge group of loving people that I pushed away and treated poorly and so much more. I have to find a place to live soon with nowhere to go and no money saved. How do you get through not drinking when everything hurts and you still have to look at your losses every day? (including my ex's new girlfriend who is friends with all of my housemates so I have to interact with her every couple days, unless he's sleeping over there and I have to see his bike at her house on the way to literally anything. I get triggered and drink every time I see her and I am forced to see her.) I'm shattered. I have no hope. 

I knew months and months and even years ago that my drinking would lose me everything. But I'd rationalize every time. Now it's all gone. How do you pick yourself up into sobriety from a situation like this?",t3_o1hblx
99,There's been a 6 pack in my fridge for 2 months.,"My wife got it as a gift from a friend and has not touched it. Its in my garage fridge (old beer fridge, now sparkly water fridge) I see it every day when I'm feeding my sparkly water addiction. That fridge used to be a constant cycle of various beers and white claws being refilled and emptied on a regular basis.

A few months ago, I would have found an excuse to crack that 6 pack. and it would have just got mixed into my rotation and disappeared. My wife would have probably ended up getting about 1 sip out of the 6 beers her friend got for her while I disposed of the rest of them into my gut.

But not anymore... It might sit there for another year... but I don't even care at this point. Its not for drinking.

107,I’ve gotta stop,"I suspect that I’m a high functioning alcoholic. Most days I wake up, work at my job, pay my bills, and deal with any issues that pop up. Then, like clockwork, around five in the evening, I start drinking. I never drive while impaired, and I’ve never blacked out, but lately I’ve usually been halfway between buzzed and loose as a goose from five to around eleven at night. I’ve had roughly seven drinks tonight, which is not abnormal lately. But I’m not a “TV drunk” as in I don’t slur my words or stumble around. I have a pretty high tolerance. Funny thing is, my dad never touched a drop, largely because my grandfather liked the booze a bit much. 

No one’s ever joked or asked me about excessive drinking- funny thing is, I didn’t touch alcohol until I was 22. 

But I’ve gotta stop- I can tell it’s taking my health bit by bit and will eventually nuke my liver. I never thought this would be me.",t3_o1nkwm
108,This is how I'm doing it differently.,"It's the question that gets asked every time you relapse. ""What are you going to do differently this time?""

Well, you sober assholes, I'll tell you what I'm doing and feel free to poke holes in it. 

\- Got a new AA sponsor with eight years of sobriety who basically has the same life story as me and I couldn't possibly relate to more. He's requiring me to call him every day and meet with him once a week for step work and, \*gasp\*, he wants to meet my girlfriend and soon-to-be-wife and ingratiate myself into his personal life with his own wife and kids. He's also requiring me to make sober friends which, to be honest, I'm so fucking terrified of because 99.6% of sober people I've interacted with in meetings have not been folks I've seen myself regularly socializing with or being friends with for that matter.  
\- Going to couples counseling with a therapist that specializes in having one of them being a drunk POS like me. Fun. Shouldn't be confrontational or one-sided at all.  
\- 90 meetings in 90 days. I've been in and out of AA for ten miserable years with 2.5 years being my longest stint and here I am doing the most basic newcomer shit I could conjure up and I don't give a shit about it one bit. I have that ""gift of desperation"" and I'm going to make hay with it.   
\- I'm talking to folks at work (I'm employed by an extremely high-stress, high-powered, high-impact org within an org that does not tolerate slacking) about what's going on, proactively and without a filter, about what's going on and why I haven't been Mr. Starshine lately. Results have...not been great.  
\- This is the most painful one. I recommended my girlfriend to Al-Anon meetings. It feels like handing her the Cheat Codebook and introducing her to a bunch of abused crazies that will tell her to leave my ass without the slightest bit of context or nuance as I have seen happen dozens of times to those that aren't fully committed to actually working the program and just want to be validated via 1-3 meetings. Wow, that sounded super judgmental, but I also have 10 years of experience to back that up. I'm not sure how wise that was, but the second she told me she felt like ""she had no one to talk to or relate to,"" I caved and told her about it. That might bite me in the ass, regardless of how much progress I make and how quickly I do so. We'll so how that journey of growth goes guys!!!

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk. Idk what I expect out of this group, this is probably like the 9th account I've created on here in the 10 years I've been spewing my unadulterated and prejudiced nonsense. I just want shit to be different this time. I honestly HATE how positive y'all are. The counting of days? That means absolutely nothing to chronic relapsers like me who have had tons of time but haven't been able to sustain. In fact, if anything it discourages us. 

Net-net/TL;DR: I desperately want to get better and have to abandon my negative and skeptic attitude, and I'm genuinely doing things differently, but I need to be called out and challenged on my callousness and ambivalence towards the recovery program I've chosen, which happens to be AA, a program I'm almost too well-versed in for it to work for me.",t3_o1nhpz
109,Astronauts,"When I was woken at 5:30 this morning, I wasn’t excited. I am under the care of the person I love most in the world, but who I thought doesn’t know how to help me. 

What transpired in today’s adventure was unexpected, as I magically morphed into a younger version of me - nerding out all day and truly in awe “on the shoulders of Giants.” 

While at moments today, ever present regret and the understanding that my choices along the way kept me from being an astronaut.. not an actual goal of mine.. just mean truly living to my full potential - that wasn’t the spirit of the day.

My inner light shown bright in me again: the young me - the *actual me* - came alive - my eyes again bright and full of wonder. All the heavy as of late melted away...

Thankful to the thinkers and dreamers, to the nerds, and those who would not accept the word impossible. 

Today’s adventure pulled me off the edge of the cliff and back into the light.

For anyone else wondering if things will ever get better, today was a reminder to me that it can.

110,Day 173 Been attending a lot of AA Zoom,"I am very curious.  I am trying to understand the difference between people who quit drinking and move on living fulfilling lives, and those who are ""lifers"" in AA and think they need it to be a success.  I think the difference is people in AA believe they must stay active in AA or they will drink. Or they are worried if they are not ""Working the program"" on a daily basis, it will lead them to being a ""Dry drunk"".  Cigarettes are more addictive than alcohol, and people quit and walk away all the time. The difference must be never getting to a place of acceptance and happiness of realizing for whatever reason enough alcohol was consumed to alter brain wiring and trigger cravings, so secretly they wish they could change this fact and keep drinking. I am participating in AA to do the steps, and then plan to move on with my life. Any thoughts?  IWnDWYT",t3_o16va5
111,Addicted to drinking - especially during the week when ADHD medicine causes crashes,"Hi all. I'm a 31 year old that works in a technology desk job. Since my late teens, I've taken adhd medicine. The crashes from this medicine are fucking unbearable. Drinking a few beers or mixed drinks is the only thing that can make me feel like my normal self.

So each night after work, I feel the need to drink. Until I've had a few, I'm a complete dick to my wife. No empathy. Don't want to talk. It's like I become a zombie. I'm a shell of myself.

I have tried almost every adhd medicine available on market. Some don't help with my actual adhd and others make my crash worse. I can't figure it out and it's going to eventually ruin my marriage. I was recently prescribed to escitaloprám as an anti depressant but that doesn't seem to help. 

Has anyone else dealt with something similar to this?

I still drink when not on adhd medicine but it isn't with the same intent. When I'm on adhd medicine, the main reason I drink is to shake the crash and try to restore my normal personality. On weekends, I honestly can stop at any time.",t3_o1n4r2
112,Day 4 and it's like the universe threw me a bone today to keep going,"Up until this past weekend I've been drinking almost daily, regularly going on 3-4 day benders where I just start again as soon as I wake up assuming I have vodka in the house. Many trips to CVS or the gas station just for alcohol and mixers. 

Because of this I've been neglecting everything in my life. Have a garage full of my mom's stuff that I need to go through and sell most of. Have 3 cars just sitting in the driveway even though I only leave the house 3-4 times a week and usually just down to the store. Have put on a lot of weight. Etc 

Well I'm 4 days in, and got up at 8:00am today, showered, went to Target, washed my car, then came home and was doing a bunch of cleaning when I get a text from a friend that works at a car lot offering to buy both of my more expensive cars for $7k more than I was expecting to get because they have an empty lot.

A week ago I'd have been drunk and/or too hungover to take care of selling them. Being sober kept me from missing out on $45k today. I think this is what I needed to really commit this time.",t3_o1buel
113,So I booked a trip.,"For me, travelling has always been about drinking. The airport beer is a weird part of my country's culture. We have fairly strict rules for selling alcohol, but at the airport you can get started at 6AM and no one will frown at your for it. So the airport beer has always been a highlight for me. From there, there would be beers on the plane, beers on arrival, day drinking at the destination, nights out drinking, drinking visiting breweries and wineries, and so on.  


But I've had it with these motherfracking beers on these motherfracking vacations.  


I haven't had a drop of alcohol for 8 months, and now I've booked my first trip. I'm going all by myself with only my mountain bike and running shoes as company. I'm going to Bergen, a city I've never been to before. It's a city I want to experience because of its part in books I've read recently, and because it has a few highly rated vegan restaurants. I want to go there because of reasons other than drinking. 

And I'm going to get up early, run and bike around the hills around the city and see everything. Do all the things that has filled my time with meaning in this new life of mine, and do it all alone so I can squeeze in as much as possible without family and other responsibilities.

118,Starting Over,"Hey everyone, this is my first time ever posting on reddit so I apologize if the formatting of anything is strange. I joined because I found this group and you seemed helpful.

I've been a closet alcoholic for a long time, and last year it really spiraled out of control. I managed to quit cold turkey and had a sober 8 months that were some of the best of my life. About a month ago I relapsed and it got really bad, really fast. It's scary to think how I could go from being sober and happy to going on what was basically a miserable month long bender. 

For my health and my sanity, I need to quit this. 

My most recent intake of alcohol was last night at around 10pm. Since I have kept my shameful habit a secret from my loved ones, I am once again going cold turkey and fear withdrawal symptoms that may be worse than what I've experienced in the past. Typically when I clean up the only real withdrawal symptoms I experience are days of insomnia and sleep paralysis (or night terrors?). Sucky, but manageable. There's always the fear of something worse each time though. I am hoping that since I only drank for a month it won't be too bad, but I was drinking some pretty shocking quantities (probably a handle in 2 days at the worst).

I just wanted to let you all know that I am starting my sober journey again and that I'm scared and sad. Wish me luck.",t3_o18yu2
119,Today marks A WHOLE YEAR since I had a drink!,"I have been sober for a whole year. Un-freaking-believable. I thought I'd never be able to stop; I was dependent on alcohol, drank a bottle of wine a night plus vodka and hid drink round the house, all the usual tricks. Getting cancer didn't stop me and neither did a heart attack a couple of years ago. Like lots of people I started drinking more during lockdown and then something just snapped and I decided to stop. I've been very lucky; the first couple of weeks were tough but once I'd decided to stop I didn't struggle with it. I have an iron will which probably makes me a nightmare to live with but does come in useful sometimes! I also read the Annie Grace book and though consciously I wasn't massively impressed with it it must have had an effect because I suddenly couldn't stomach the thought of alcohol at all, it was as though I'd developed a complete aversion to it.

During this year I've realised that one of the reasons I drank so much was to escape my melancholia. I've had depression my entire adult life, and it's treated and under control, but I was trying to deny it with drink. I'm an extroverted introvert and I think I was trying to mask the introvert too much; now I'm calmer and a bit less manic and more at peace with the cheerfully gloomy, Celtic part of my personality. And I've realised that my life is pretty good, and I'm a pretty good person, and really there's nothing I need to escape from.

I don't post here much, but I lurk all the time and the sub has been a great support. I find everyone's stories really moving and it's been a revelation how much we all have in common.

121,Nearly 13 months sober and curious if I'm capable of moderate drinking.,"Hi friends. 

I've been a lurker in /r/stopdrinking for around two years now. (Had an older account before this one). 

On May 22nd, 2020, I decided that I was going to finally stop drinking. 

The past four or five years had been filled with excuses and relapses and honestly, I was just so sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

The first three months were hard, but the next three were the worst for some reason. Then, it progressively got easier. 

During my journey, I decided to go to therapy to figure my life out and along the way, I was diagnosed with ADHD-C at age 28. 

This felt like a missing puzzle piece and suddenly everything in my life made sense. 

I was very open with my doctor and therapist about my addictions (inhalents and then booze) and I expressed that I was worried about getting medicated as I didn't want to abuse the medication. 

Both my doctor and therapist told me that I didn't seem like someone who would abuse medication, and that I likely developed my addictions as coping mechanisms to help deal with my ADHD. 

In January of 2021, I started taking Vyvanse and it's genuinely changed my entire life for the better. 

The other day, my wife and I were at the grocery store and she bought a six pack of some new cider that she was excited to try and for the first time in what feels like ages, I craved a drink. 

It was a brief moment and my immediate reaction was to shut it down and think, ""You don't do that anymore, Tyler."" 

But over the past week I've been wondering... could I drink in moderation?

If my doctor and therapist were right, then I'm curious if I could casually drink once in a while and be alright. 

However, I'm very aware of ""bargaining"" and trying to convience myself that ""We'll just do one or two, it'll be fine."" and then waking up miserable and afraid to look at my phone.

So, part of me wonders if this is me just trying to convince myself to give up 13 months of sobriety and start over - or, maybe I am actually able to control myself. 

I'm posting here in hopes of getting honest opinions.
 
I know that no one can tell me what would happen for sure. But I also know that everyone here has been through this song and dance with booze, and I trust the opinions of those who've been to the bottom most.

All of this seems completely meaningless. I’m so profoundly sad that none of this was good enough for her. After she said she had dreams that we were pregnant and she felt so safe and happy. And then the next day she says she doesn’t like the person she is with me. 

What am I supposed to do??? I genuinely don’t think I can do any more things in my life, and yet I’m still not good enough and just profoundly sad.

Community is everything, and I know I wouldn't be here without the honesty and support of this group. The good and the bad, these are our stories, and it's nothing to feel ashamed about.

Going through some crazy stuff at work, and it's making it difficult to focus.  Spending too much time on SD, but better than the alternative.

133,Anyone else get urges to drink only when they’re having a good day?,"I have no desire to drink when I’m in a bad mood, tired, sick, or anxious. 

But whenever I have a good day (active, working out, energetic, happy, nice weather) — the impulse to drink comes back. 

It’s like an “enhancement” to keep the good day going. My brain re-convinces itself that some wine would make for a great relaxing night. 

Anyone else have this problem? Are there ways to think or talk to myself when I’m feeling good?

Thanks!",t3_o0l9tk
134,One year tomorrow - Recovery is ongoing,"Tomorrow marks my one year of sobriety. This is sooooo huge. I'm not exactly sure, but because of my parents' ""oh one glass of wine won't hurt!"" all throughout my teenage years, I probably haven't had a fully sober year since I was 11. Hooray!!

My husband and I have planned to mark the occasion by celebrating together today, since there are family obligations tomorrow. But I had a busy day at work planned that was really stressing me out so he encouraged me to call out sick and take a mental health day. I would say ""my better judgment was telling me not to,"" but that's false -- my better judgment was telling me it was a good idea but it was my ANXIETY that was discouraging me from calling out. You know, that constant need to perform, to self-sacrifice, to put others first and show how capable we are at all times. 

With all the anxiety bells ringing in my head, I still decided that I needed this, so I called out sick and settled in to trying to enjoy my day off. But sure enough, the people I contacted did not relay the message (my office manager left weeks ago apparently?!!) And so I get a phone call from the higher ups being like ""did you know you were scheduled to work today?"" 

Ughhhhhh..... 
I still took the sick day
But  I've spent the last hour talking myself down off that heart-attack-inducing ledge. End result: I got my sober anniversary holiday, I got better information about who to contact in case I need to call out (again communication that probably should have been spelled out earlier since I've been working here a year!!!), and I've gotten a very valuable lesson reminding myself of maintaining boundaries in respect to my own needs. 

I owe my employer fair work for a fair wage. I DO NOT owe my employer the kind of work-til-you-drop mentality that wreaks havoc on my happiness, my sanity, or my peace of mind. Maintaining boundaries to protect that will better protect my overall health and my SOBRIETY. So I can take this with me moving forward to schedule my vacations better, make my work calendar more manageable, and do better about not letting it get to this point again. 

Thank you for reading. I'm so happy to be hear celebrating this soberversary and celebrating learning these important life lessons. Love you all!!!! IWNDWYT",t3_o16dn9
135,Day 11…and another sunrise,"Day 11 for me. It’s hard to believe that such a small number and seemingly short amount of time can mean so much to me and my family. I can’t remember the last sunrise i watched, and now i have seen two in the last week. Previously, going to bed at 2am each night after drinking a half bottle of bourbon and waking each morning slightly hungover, it was a challenge to get up much before 8 or 9am. Now I’m in bed around 10, reading with my wife, and waking naturally with ease around 5:30 or 6 - an unexpected serendipity of getting sober. 

My sober moment came after a disastrous rock bottom moment.  I’m doing everything I can to stay sober and not relapse.  Weekly AA meetings, started running again yesterday, weekly Smart Recovery meetings, taking a 5 day relapse prevention course starting next week, reading articles on alcoholism and will do some counselling, had one session already. I’ve also reached out to family and friends letting them know I’m an alcoholic and that I’ve secretly been drinking for years.  

This is my journey, I’m owning it, and so far this is what’s working for me.  No two journeys are the same, what is working for me so for likely won’t work for someone else. But hopefully the more we all share the more tools and methods we all have access to try and test. 

And of course, I’m here on this community, sharing and commenting on other posts daily. This community has been invaluable, helping provide that sense of normalcy and belonging.  I am not alone, we are not alone.  Thank you to everyone here.  Standing tall and strong with you.",t3_o13jh0
136,I finally told my doctor the extent of my drinking,"I live in a town with a medical school and teaching hospital. The family medicine clinic I go to gets residents who spend 3 years in the clinic before usually moving on to another clinic. My doctor of three years (the amount of time I've increased social drinking of one or two to a real problem with lots of binges) recently graduated residency and moved on. I had to pick a new doctor, and I chose one I've met a few times before. He seems really great.

I made the appointment to establish care as well as to get medical guidance for being sober. He wanted to know everything about my drinking and my health in general. I deal with chronic pain. I'm in pain everyday. So far it's looking like endometriosis and adenomyosis. I see a specialist next month for it actually. A portion of my drinking was to numb the pain or get intoxicated enough that I stopped caring about being in pain. Another portion was for CPTSD. Anyways. 

For the first time, I was perfectly honest (to the best of my memory) about my drinking. How much, how often, what led to it, my drinks of choice, etc. I told him I was scared I may have damaged my liver or kidneys. I explained no previous doctor really pried into how much I drank or how often, and I never brought it up. I didn't want to tell them out of shame, fear, denial, and because I didn't want to stop drinking. 

He said with the amount I drank, it wouldn't have been unheard of for me to have had severe withdrawal symptoms, but I am probably out of the woods for those now. He didn't lecture me. He didn't appear to judge me. He told me he admires my decision to quit and to be honest about it, and he listed a bunch of blood tests he wanted to run to see where my organ function is at and to help make a plan for what is next medically. 

He also asked if I was interested in trying pain medications, including opiates, for my pain. I explained that because I'm in pain every single day, it seemed like it could easily lead to problems. I told him about the times I've taken opiates after pelvic surgery and after breaking my leg. They didn't help THAT much, and I don't want to risk opioid dependency. He agreed with that and said we would keep searching for the cause of my pain to treat it directly. 

I just wanted to tell this to people that would understand. This was a big step for me. I did a good thing today. I also ordered a few books online about alcohol and sobriety. I just started this journey, and I want to be successful. I think I've got the courage now to go to an AA meeting soon and listen to what it has to offer.

139,Slowly learning alcohol does not run my life anymore,"So I had one of the biggest benders of my life last week. Wow. It wasn’t even a full week ago. It feels like each day that passes I want to remove myself from it more and more. Every scary/cringy/manipulative thing I did during those two weeks has ran thru my mind every second of every hour since I sobered up on Thursday. So I guess Thursday marks a week. It feels like a month because of how much clearer and happier I feel mentally. I spent this past weekend staying in and doing productive ass stuff. Like cleaning out my fridge! Who does that on a Saturday? Anyways, this may be sort of a ramble. But I think my 2 week drug/alcohol/etc bender actually happened for a reason. Before that I was pretending to get sober. I would go 2-4 days and then justify a drink. Or 6. Or 9. Anyways, 6 days sober (although there was a beer consumed during a date, but I take that as a HUGE win as Ive typically take 3-5 shots before every single date I’ve been on &amp; always got hammered during the date. Always. So going on a date sober, like actually showing up sober and ordering a beer (I wasn’t ready to tell him I wasn’t drinking) and then going home that night at a decent hour felt like I achieved more than I have in my life! Tonight, force myself to get out and go to a guys place that I sort of dated a few years ago, and talked SOBER for 3 hours! Then I drove home. All 100% sober. I am actually excited to wake up for the gym tomorrow, which will be day 5 in a row. The last time I went to the gym 5 days in a row was pre-covid. Anyways, what I’m saying is that I am understanding that alcohol does not have to control my life  I can have fun and be myself without it. Why did it take 10-15 years for me to figure this out? Actually figure it out? I can no longer be know as “the drunk girl”. Life seems to be really looking up. I hope this inspires someone on day 1 because I know how hard it can be and IWNDWYT.

140,It’s All So Mindless,"Hey SD,

Back with another rant! I feel like while I may not always be sober that I’m learning some things in the process. Trying to stay positive. 

Recently it just feels like my drinking is on autopilot. I don’t even necessarily want to drink but seem resigned to the fact that I’m going to. There’s a thought and an awareness but it all rolls downhill into boozeville. 

I get home from work, exhausted, hungry and then I just head right for the booze. For a long time it was an “I deserve this” or “fuck this day I’m going to get fucked up,” and sometimes it still is. But recently it’s just just a mindless I guess I’m drinking. 

I’ve had some serious binges in the last little while. Drinking mindlessly, turns into eating mindlessly, turns into smoking mindlessly, turns into shit sleep and a hellacious day. It’s not even a physical hangover so much as a mental hangover nowadays. I just feel downright stupid and my anxiety and depression are all over. Not to mention my exhaustion.

Recently I’ve had some days that I’ve been sober after a long day, made myself some dinner, and chilled out at home. I slept well. I woke rested. And I felt so good the next day! It was miraculous! I think I’m finally seeing some of the benefits of sobriety. 

Previously I just seemed like I was in a fog of hangovers and depression. I kinda feel like myself some of these sober days! I’m on it and active and eat well and I’m so much less bloated and lithe. 

I gotta keep remembering that. I “treated myself” last night, my Friday, to mindless drinking, even though I didn’t really want to. So today isn’t my brightest day. But it’s sunny and I’m off on a walk. I have a friends get together tonight so I’m not sure where that will take me. They do have kombucha on tap where we’re going so maybe, for the first time in forever, I’ll be sober at a get together.",t3_o1dwns
141,Drinking and Bipolar,"I’m on mobile so excuse the formatting.

Today is my second day sober and i’m dealing with the repercussions of being an alcoholic with Bipolar 2. I’ve made so many excuses as to why I should drink and I’m sitting here now unable to find a single one. The regret, the shame, the anxiety, the sweats, the chills and hot flashes. All of it for what? i few nights of blacking out and letting my loved ones down. I can’t do this anymore and if I don’t stop there won’t be anything left for me to fight for. I want to quit. I’m going to spend every day making sure that I do but I’m scared. I think I will be joining an AA group to keep me on the right track and give me some confidence. Now all I can do is pray that I don’t lose the person that means the most to me.

I started reading your posts and there were several about regretting having a drink after days/months/years of sobriety. The common theme was that it wasn't worth it.

They all seem to have something going on and reading the board this week it seems like folks might just be a little more off kilter than usual.  I do not know.  Guess I am just saying what I see in my own little porthole to the World.  Nice to be here with everyone.  Nice to hear from folks.  I hope you are all having a good day.

147,Too young to let alcohol ruin my life this much. I’m so lost,"I don’t know where else to post this or how to seek help. I’m 25 and I’ve been drinking nearly everyday for 4 years.

At first it was out of enjoyment, but then about a year in it got to drinking almost a full 750ml but then soon after to drinking either a 750ml bottle of liquor or 2 to 3 bottles of wine a night. 

I was married since I was 22 and this year I’m getting divorced because of my drinking. That made me drink harder. I have no job I don’t go to school and I don’t have anything but a loving family who don’t know about my problem. 

4 days ago I booked a trip to Oregon to make a change and go backpacking and I’m here in Oregon but in pain from having thrown up uncontrollably 2 nights ago from all the drinking. In 3 nights I’ve downed 3 bottles of liquor and some beer.

For a few months now my heart has started to feel palpitations and right now I can’t keep food down and I feel so uncomfortable.

I’ve tried to quit before but i only lasted a week and it’s constantly me binging 5 days then feeling so physically and mentally terrible that i try to get sober and last two days.

So embarrassing that my family thinks I’m backpacking Oregon but in reality I’m in bed in a hotel room feeling terrible.

Any wisdom or mindfulness to take along as I tread this hopeful, yet scary ground? Thank you.

I’ve had a little something each day since. That was a week ago. Nothing crazy at all, but anything is worse than nothing. 

All that to say: don’t give in to “just one”. It’ll always lead to more.

Trying to take this one day at a time, although it’s hard not to try to look ahead at what I’m shooting for. It does feel good though to see through clear eyes for the first time in a while.

152,"First ""meltdown"" without alcohol...","Idk if it's a ""meltdown"" necessarily but this past Saturday around lunch time I just lost it and started crying at work. There were many factors - a family friend had passed the day before, I watched Bo Burnham's Inside and was having an existential crisis (lol), and work that day was extremely busy and stressful. 

I had gotten there at 7 and was still working hard around 1. I was hungry, tired and feeling a whole smorgasbord of emotions. My coworker came and asked me to train someone how to do something when I was done and that bit of extra work just made me break down and start crying. I work with lovely people so they sent me home for the day.

I got home and immediately wanted alcohol. I went back and forth about buying some when I finally decided I was going to tackle this sober. Instead of numbing myself with booze, I felt every dumb, painful, uncomfortable emotion and let myself cry as hard as I needed to. I reminded myself that no matter what, this feeling would pass and I'd be okay. And guess what? After about an hour, the fog started to lift and I ended up being in a good mood and getting a lot done around the house.

I think I'm learning that sometimes you have to break it down even further than one day at a time. Sometimes it is one SECOND at a time and that's okay. You just have to try and breathe through it and know it will pass. Easier said than done, but dammit I did it and I'm proud.

I was about to go get wine but instead I called my counsellor (he works for an addiction service I’m part of and his role involves being on call for clients if they’re in crisis). 

I talked to him and cried and cried and let it all out. He reaffirmed that I can do this and that I am strong. He was so kind and empathetic, as always, and helped me so much. 

Picking up the phone and talking to someone who understands REALLY helps. Even if you don’t feel like doing it, just try it. Before you pick up a drink, pick up the phone.

160,6/15/17,"That's four years ago today. 

When I started this journey I had absolutely no idea what I was getting myself into. I thought that life as I knew it was over (and it was!), but not in the way I imagined it. I always had a vision of what things would look like 1 year in, 2, 3, etc. But every single time I reach that milestone, its nothing like I thought it would be, but rather so much better. I've come to realize the journey is more important than the destination. While this is a special day for me because of what it represents, every single ""ordinary"" day from the beginning until now has been filled with so many little but extraordinary things. That is what makes this all so special. 

When I was using, I lived the same day on repeat. Wake up, find a way to use whatever it is I wanted to use, and then use that until I pretty much had to retreat and repeat it all over again day after day. Life today is far from that, every day is so much different and each day I learn through the experiences both good and bad, which is one of the greatest gifts I have today. I could go on about the material and experiential things I have had in these last four years but that would only highlight the differences and not similarities. What I've learned is that nobody can take away the inside job that I do, that is my recovery. I can lose everything on the outside in the blink of an eye but it doesn't mean I have to lose my inner peace. 

Today life is not about a chase, its not about getting ""one more"" of whatever it is I want. It's about taking a moment to stop and realize all the wonderful things I do have. To appreciate life as it is and not *how it could be.* In my using, i loathed what was to come and held on so desperately to a past that would never come to be again. Today I live in the present moment, outside of the right now nothing else matters. I'm not perfect and I have my days where I question if I'm doing the right thing and I'm on the right path, but despite all that I just keep moving forward. I've found that if I don't use today and I just keep doing the next right thing, it will work out. 

Today, I don't have to have everything figured out. I can let things be and take the journey as it comes to me. Its when I'm truly in the moment and I reflect back on my past self and how my life was centered around desperately trying to *escape this moment* I know that I'm on the right path and I'm doing what I need to do. 

I could give you guys so many specifics of do's or don't and highlights of my journey but I don't think any piece of advice could ever be more important to me than just not using, no matter what. I know I have wonderful days and hard days ahead, and I get to experience them clean and truly live my life to the fullest today because of recovery. 

This is the greatest gift I have ever been given in my life. I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything, nor would I wish this disease of addiction upon my worst enemy. I am who I am and today I can love myself, and because of that I can love you all too, even if you're strangers on the internet. 

What started off as one decision, one day, has spiraled into a life beyond my wildest dreams.

163,36 hours in,"I’m 36 hours in to my second detox in 5 months.  I have some moderate shakes and auditory hallucinations but nothing like the first time around. 

After 85 days of sobriety I figured I could moderate, so I bought a 12 pack of IPA which I planned to drink 2 per night for the 6 nights my wife was out of town.  First night went according to plan, but by lunch the next day I was already at the planned minimum. I justified drinking the remaining 10 that day saying “it’s only beer” and no one will ever know. Ended up drinking 12 a day for the next 4 days, feeling like shit physically and emotionally, racked with guilt and anxiety about hiding my weakness from my wife and the rest of the world. I somehow managed to sober up the day she got home and she still doesn’t know about my relapse.

Within an hour of finishing my 12oz beer I became sick to my stomach and started dry heaving. In my many years of drinking, I have almost never gotten sick (thank my alcoholic genes), so this was a novel experience for me.

Here's a few things I've learned.,"I never intended to quit drinking, but I was thrust into it at the beginning of the year thanks to an alcoholic friend that threatened my life (put a knife to my throat).  Gave me quite the wake-up call.  Here I am nearly 6 months later without a drop of alcohol.  Ironically, these 6 months have been some of the hardest of my life for reasons outside of drinking, but I'm proud that I haven't used alcohol to cope.  Here's a few things I know have improved from being alcohol free: 

Sleep is GOOD.  Goodness, I didn't realize how much I was being robbed of a decent night's sleep until maybe two months in.  I'm sleeping the best that I can even remember.  Even having one drink at night screwed with my sleep cycle and would be groggy the next day.  I feel WAY better in the mornings now vs. a morning nursing a hangover. 

Mornings are SIGNIFICANTLY more manageable:  I can't stress this enough. Screw having a hangover and feeling like death the majority of the day.  I don't have that now, even with less than 7 hours of sleep. I wake up and maybe I'm not 100% sometimes but give me an hour and I'm good to go for the day.  With a hangover, I'd be dragging ass all day long.  I feel like I'm no longer wasting the mornings or the day.  Even if I'm not being productive, I'm at least feeling good enough to ENJOY it.  And that, my friends, is what life is all about.  We gotta enjoy the little things!

I haven't done anything incredibly stupid:  I think back on the dumbass shit I've done in my life, and 100% of it was alcohol-related.  No more damage control of waking up the next day trying to piece together the dumb shit I did and making apologies if I did anything out of control.  In that regard, I'd say my relationships are also better.

Better at socializing:  This is a big one.  I always used alcohol as a crutch in any social situation.  Thought I absolutely needed it to be funny and interesting.  Turns out, I don't.  Social situations still take a bit of effort on my end (i'm an introvert), but being able to face these without a drink was a massive win for me.  I also no longer feel so uncomfortable in social situations where alcohol ISN'T available.  

Fewer empty calories:  I'd probably lose weight, but the issue is I've replaced the drinking with ice cream or a treat at night.  Oh well!  If you took that out, no doubt you'd lose weight.  

Healthier outlets: There are other things out there to give you happiness, without the negatives of alcohol.  For me, I've taken up swimming three times a week.  I don't know what it is about this particular exercise, but it gives me mental benefits that last days afterwards.  I am significantly happier after I swim.  I'd love to find other stuff too that are mood boosting without the drawbacks.  They seem to be out there!

Thought I'd share these in case it's helpful.  I will say, my life ain't perfect by any stretch, like I said, I'm in the middle of some stressful shit.  But I do look back and see there are benefits I've had from not drinking.  At this point, I don't see any reason to drink again.  Shit is toxic on so many levels, and would likely be outlawed if it were discovered today.  

Take care y'all, and best wishes to you!",t3_o0d8q7
167,When did you turn it around?,"Today I'm feeling a bit like I have achieved nothing.

I know this is not true and I have huge accomplishments. However I am 30. I have no savings. I have a career but not a 'job's so I'm feeling a bit lost. 

I'm looking back on the last 10 years thinking ""why the fuck did I spend so much fucking time partying instead of saving or exercising or I dont know *working*""

Anyway I want to hear from anyone who has maybe felt the same way and managed to turn it around at a later stage? 

I know I'm not old and I still have time. The next 10 years can be incredible depending on how I use it.

But I need some motivation today. How did you turn it around after being trapped in the alcohol or partying and avoidance cycle?

Thanks!",t3_o0zyc9
168,49 More days until I hit my one year. So close! yet I still fear being social,"I hope you all are doing well and trying your best to shine your light forward to those who need it. I am so proud to know that I am a part of this community. You all are wonderful people and have done a lot for people like me. I wouldnt be here if this place didnt exist.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been focusing hard on getting my life back together. New job, lost a ton of weight, active in the gym. Ive lost over 325 lbs with me having 65% body fat to now 13% averaging. Been off opiates and alcohol this entire time and damn proud of it..... 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet I know what I did in the past and I am afraid of being social again and falling back into that pattern. Life rocks and I truly love to talk to people, when I go out I am friendly with everyone. I cannot convince myself to text them though or follow through with plans still. I am terrified I will be that guy again who steals pills from his sick mother. Who will lie like no tomorrow to those who love me most. I will just bail on all of my new friends or I will be awkward cause its been 3 years since I have been social. I am terrified and clueless on how to meet people and hang out. Idk if anyone has any tips on how to meet people in a non sober world while being sober.",t3_o0pg9u
169,58 hours,"58 hours ago I made the decision to stop. 

To give a little bit of a back story I’m 30, joined the military at 29. It’s my first time being out of my home state. I’ve been going through some pretty intensive schools for my job. I’m constantly moving around, making awesome friends along the way and then having to leave them, several months ago my grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer after beating lung cancer, and to top it off I knew I was going to be moving over 4,000 miles away and across an ocean from everything and everyone I’ve ever known. 

In the last 9 months leading up to my move I’ve been drinking almost daily, taking a break here and there but going on 48 hour benders on the weekends. Usually drinking at least a pint on the weekdays and a1/5th a day on the weekends. The longer it’s been happening the more I’ve been worried about it. I started to count down the hours until I could get my first drink of the day. I started drinking roadies when with my friends. I found myself trying to make sure I could get drunk when going out with my friends. I’m embarrassed about my hand tremors when writing or picking stuff up. I get a “cloudy brain” and it affects my social interactions with people. I only felt normal when I was drinking. 

The last few weeks I had seriously been finding the desire to get sober. I knew when I arrived at my final duty station I would have to quarantine for 10 days and I would use that time do it. I had packed a 1/5th in my bag. I drank that. I got someone to drop off a half gallon and about halfway through that I knew I had to put my foot down when I found myself waking up and making a drink before my breakfast was even delivered to me. 58 hours ago I drank my last sip. I kept about a pint in the half gallon just incase my withdrawal symptoms were too severe. 58 hours later I poured it down the drain. I’m done. 

I had insomnia, shaky hands, headache, nausea, stomach pains, wrestles legs. Overall it wasn’t too bad. I’m still struggling with sleep but that should get better soon. 

Before I joined the military I abused drugs for a few years but I quit cold turkey so I could join. I lost 110 lbs so I could join. I can do this.",t3_o0vxx1
170,How do I sleep?????,"I'm finally ready to quit. I enjoy the feeling of no substances in my body and having a clear head. I've gotten past the boredom, the antsyness, and all the withdrawal bullshit. But I still haven't figured out one thing and that's how the frick do I get to sleep at night? I tried taking a couple shots, and sometimes that works and sometimes not, and even then I can only sleep 2 to 4 hours. I've tried 5HTP and melatonin, doesn't seem to do much. Exercise is just as likely to rev me up as it is to exhaust me. And before you ask, no I didn't consume any caffeine today. I want to be free of this bullshit drug! How to I sleep?",t3_o11yox
171,I bought a 12 pack of beer yesterday,"So I'm on vacation in Florida with my family/in laws and I had to leave the beach early cause my daughter needed a break. Everyone else stayed and once we got back to the rental property, we decided to go get a few things we needed at the grocery store. I called my wife to ask if there was anything that anyone else wanted and my sister in law wanted Tecate. I didn't hesitate at all and said sure. It was weird buying it but it really didn't bother me at all. I'm still sober and have no interest in drinking even on vacation. In fact, I have done lots of reflecting on my past drinking when we where on vacation and I couldn't do any anything with out a drink in my hand. I would make promises to my family to do something fun and flake  out cause I was drunk. It feels great to be sober and remember every moment. Tonight we are gonna go sea shell hunting at low tide and I would have never done that before. I'm just glad to be present in the moment and not stressing. IWNDWYT",t3_o0ifib
172,Thank you,I had a different username and I stopped for a while but not too long - 6 months. I thought I got better and could handle some wine on the weekends. Limit myself to 3 or so on a Saturday. I’m back to 50 units a week. Just yesterday 10 drinks. It’s enough I really can’t keep this going. I just want to say thank you to all you posting that keep me comfortable enough to admit I have a problem and need help. Thank you for your supportive comments and your posts of your honest feelings and experiences that make me want to keep trying to get better. IWNDWYT.,t3_o0w42d
173,What does being sober feel like?,"So I've been reflecting today on what being sober feels like... and I've had a hard time nailing it down. 

Sometimes, when I'm sober I'm tired. I'm sad or lethargic. Sometimes I'm relaxed, or happy or ecstatic. Sometimes, when I'm sober I even feel a bit drunk/high, like reality is fuzzy around the edges. 

I guess what I realised is that being sober doesn't really feel like anything. Or it has the possibility to feel like everything. It's a blank canvas, an unwritten page, an unbroken silence. The void in which everything exists. Boundless potential.

Being drunk, only ever feels like being drunk. It's a bit woozy, and bit foggy, and on a bad occasion, down right miserable. It's so... limited.

That's how I see it, anyway. How do you guys? Would you say being sober feels a certain way?",t3_o0snfs
174,My Girlfriend has stopped drinking for over a year now.,"Last month marked her year of sobriety and Out of just a random act of BF kindness and this community, I would like some of you to please give her a shout out, a nice message of encouragement or anything so I can show her tomorrow when she comes over 😊 her name is Amber. Thanks 👍",t3_o0fd2l
175,100 days.,"Well, I made it to my goal of 100 days. 

I feel great. But I don’t feel proud. I feel like this is what I should have been doing all along. It’s a strange feeling. 

Anyone else feel this way?",t3_o0spm3
176,Fuuuuuuuuck,"Socializing without alcohol is so much harder. Especially coming out of the pandy. Anyone else feel like a big, dumb robot?",t3_o0wt4c
177,"So I fell off the wagon again, hard. Back on it now and have a question about what to expect after I get off Valium.","So I started drinking again. Afternoon, night, sometimes mornings. Only for 3 or 4 weeks but I was going pretty hard.

I decided to quit again and started going into DTs. Hallucinations, shakes, 180/110 BP. The works. I was too embarrassed to go to the hospital so I grabbed a 3 week supply of Valium from a friend. 

Its working fantastically. Zero cravings. I was even around other people drinking and a bar but I held strong. I do NOT want to be on Valium for a long period of time but I feel like I may need them for a month or so to let my.body fully recover without the need to drink. Obviously there will be some withdrawal when I stop taking them but have I just been pushing of DTs or will my body have adjusted to not having alcohol in its system ?",t3_o12tt3
178,Day 1,"Im 22 (Male) and have been drinking consistently for the last 2 years, today is my first day of sobriety wish me luck.",t3_o0v0aa
179,I can't sleep and I keep failing at being sober,"I can go about a day now without drinking but I immediately have one after a day break. I guess I am drinking less overall now, I was drinking about a bottle or more of liquor at the height of covid. I am lying to my partner about it. I have heavy depression and negative thoughts running through my head. I have a new therapist today but I think I need meds and not just a talk session.",t3_o14sef
180,Vegas,"I had a trip planned and was already thinking and telling my friend before I left that I felt I was going to “crack.”  She talked me through it.   I made it three days in Vegas AF.  I really can’t believe I made it.  Like seriously.   I know to many it’s not that big a deal, but in our community it’s HUGE and you all here would understand me.  I’ve now got a major holiday weekend (Memorial Day), a beach outing with friends and now Vegas (all SOBER) under my belt.  I’ve got prayer warriors praying for me. I’m armed with my book recommendations and alcohol experiments shared from this community.   I’m almost at 30 days and that was my first goal. But now I want to continue my streak from seeing how much improved your lives are being AF.   Thank you all for just being here and sharing your struggles and your triumphs.  IWNDWYT 💪",t3_o0v0fk
181,This relapse was different,So I fucked up. My husbands birthday I had a bunch to drink. I didn't even enjoy it. I woke up hung over as fuck.  This time was different though. Before I was relapsing and id be full of self pitty and feelings like I'll never be sober because I can't. This time I'm just well that was stupid and pointless I'm never doing that again. You guys are so right. The relapsing and getting up and starting over IS 100% part of the process. I achieved over 30 days! I fucked up BUT and a huge but I can do this. I have been doing this the whole time. Dusting my self off. IWNDWYT!,t3_o0hy3j
182,I seem to be losing control,I’ve noticed my drinking has become pretty frequent. And whenever I do drink I drink until I black out there is no having just one because once I taste it I need more. I’ve had stuff happen in the past  in my life and I just want it to go away. Alcohol did that for me but now it’s starting to ruin the relationships around me due to my drinking. I crave it everyday and cannot seem to stop. It seems as though no one cares or gives a crap whether I throw my life away as a drunk. I do not see any point in life and look forward to not much in life. I need help trying to quit it seems impossible from where I am right now though. Please help.,t3_o111o3
183,Drinking always meant one step forward and two steps back,"Hi everyone! Today I have 802 days sober. When I was drinking, I still accomplished some things. I graduated college. I got a job. I had friends. But every time I succeeded in some way, I also fucked up in another way. The progress was limited. I was constantly putting out fires or cleaning up messes I had made (figuratively and literally) due to my drinking. Life felt like trying to fill a bathtub when its drain is too big. No matter what I did, I couldn’t get ahead. I couldn’t learn from my mistakes because I was too distracted by making new ones. 

Today I don’t live like that. I still fuck up, but sobriety gives me a chance to learn and grow. Especially since I remember things now and I actually feel my feelings all the way through. I see the other side of things. I have a fair chance at getting ahead now because I don’t have alcohol holding me back. Life doesn’t feel like playing an unfair game of juggling where I have one hand and five balls. Today I can focus on what’s in front of me while having hope for my goals and dreams. Hell, when I was drinking, I didn’t even have dreams. I was just trying to survive. Today I get to live. Thanks for reading.",t3_o0vudz
184,"Did bloodwork yesterday, and the doctor called today saying I have high elevated something of the liver..","Not going to lie, I'm scared shitless.  I'm 26/M and drink around 5x a week in the evenings.  He wants to meet with me and his next available appointment isn't for two days.. ughhhhh

185,Tiredness/sleep,"Today I am 23 days AF. It took about 15 days for me to start sleeping some what normal again- and I started feeling great, lot’s of energy and very productive.

187,fuck. withdrawals.,"hi guys. Lurked here for awhile, but here I am now.
21/f/180 pounds
Drank everyday for 6 months back in 2019, ended up with psychosis and went into rehab.

Flash forward to now. I got pregnant with my beautiful babygirl when I got out of rehab. Almost a year sober. Started drinking again last week after court with her dad. 

8 day bender, fifth of vodka a day. 

Diagnosed with BPD type 1 and got off my meds.

Went to hospital today and got fluids and nausea meds.

I can’t sleep. The auditory and visuals are so bad. Took a Xanax to calm myself, my heart rate is decent, bouncing between 90-100. Shakes ARENT bad. But I’m so fucking tired and cant sleep. What else can I do? Will it get worse from here? Rehab isn’t much of an option considering I don’t want a dfs case.",t3_o0wedo
188,11 weeks already!,Not sure what the final straw was for me. I’m 43 and sometimes I beat myself up for not doing this sooner. It’s truly never too late! There really is no future in it. That simple.,t3_o0touy
189,A year sober today.,"It hasn't been easy, and in truth it's only been the last couple of  months that I've started to really feel good again. Diet, excercise, sleep and trying to work on my mental health are going to be my focus for this next phase of sobriety.

For those starting off just do what you have to to get through it. If that means staying in bed, eating crap and watching boxsets then just do that. The important thing is to just break the habit. The desire does get less and less. 

My anxiety has decreased dramatically and I don't have that constant feeling of self loathing and shame anymore. The constant inner monologue about will I drink today has gone which is probably my favourite aspect. That was exhausting. 

I am a better partner and parent and am not consumed by irrational anger anymore. 

This community has been invaluable particularly at the beginning. The post where people have kindly shared their relapse stories   have been saved for reference and I read them anytime feel the urge. Thank you to everyone who shares their experiences. 

I have come to the realisation that I drank due to anxiety, depression and a lack of self worth.

But now when I am having bad days I can  look at myself in the mirror and know that it is not because I am drinking and that is the best feeling. 

For anybody struggling keep at it, I promise it gets better. 

I will not drink with you today.",t3_o0cguv
190,Made it 6 days,"I just messaged the badge bot, because after going 6 days, I drank two beers Monday, and two on Tuesday. 

My BPD mother is in town, and I kinda knew I wasn’t going to make it through her visit without any. I’m trying not to beat myself up, but I am a little disappointed. This was the first test since I decided I was really going to try and stop. 

One thing, though- when I decided that I was going to drink, I told myself and my husband that I was going to have two each day. The first day, I could have had a third, but was able to stop myself.

I am extremely happy to have joined this community.

Now I’m about 50 days in. I don’t check that app often and just take it day by day, but today I did. When I saw the photo of myself only 2 months ago I could see deeply into my soul: how sad I was, how I had no direction, how I regretted the night before, how I neglected my aspirations, and how I much I needed help. I would’ve never admitted any of those at the time.

I've been home from work for about an hour with the wife and toddler. Normally I'd be sipping beer all night which somehow made an otherwise mundane evening fun. Made playing toddler games much more enjoyable. Now I feel like I'm going crazy pacing around bored out of my mind with no idea what do do or pass the next few hours until I go to sleep.

196,Scared of a bottle of liquor on the sidewalk,"I was visiting my parents at their hotel room in my town. The doors to four rooms shared a walkway and small courtyard. It was about 10am and housekeeping was cleaning rooms next to theirs. I walked out of their room, turned the corner, and almost tripped over an ice bucket with a half full bottle of liquor in it that housekeeping obviously had found and put there. I'm not going to say what it was, because it is something I drank a lot near the end and I can't even type it without being triggered. Let's just say it's a common thing for someone deep in physical dependence to drink regularly.

My immediate instinct was to just reach down, smoothly swoop it up, and tuck it in tight under my rain jacket. But, I did not do that. I stopped, pointed and it like it was a snake, and said ""there's a bottle of blank."" My sister, who was walking right behind me, glanced over and mumbled something about drunktards. (Her word... yes, I know it's rude). 

I'm bothered by how my brain went on autopilot, even if it was just for a split second, thinking ""Free booze! Just grab it. Walk away with it."" It scared me. 

I'm proud I left it alone. It's also a good reminder that my dumb alcoholic lizard brain is still lurking about in there. I guess I need to add ""dealing with unexpected booze in random public places"" to my relapse prevention plan.

I’ve been waking up sweating, but what scares me the most are the twitching/spasms that wake me up as I slowly fall asleep. I did a bit of internet browsing and it just made me more anxious (reading about hallucinations and seizures, which I haven’t had).

200,"The Daily Check-In for Tuesday, June 15th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Last Friday, SaintLisa got a false positive test for covid. Long story short - after a long weekend of isolation and quarantene, and 12 negative tests, three of them hers, we are are all off the hook today. Not just we, but also her class and her brother´s kindergarden group sigh in relief despite the ongoing outbreak. She never had any symptoms, so we were dumbfounded, but the whole ordeal certainly made its mark on us all. We learned a lot.

One of the things that I learned, again, is that I don´t need alcohol to cope. On the contrary - drinking would have made everything more blurred, more slow, more distant, and my girl and my family would have a lot more stress to handle. Events like this reinforce my resolve immensely.

203,First time runner's high! High on life!,"I don't really like doing sports, but I've always loved swimming. And usually I swim laps relatively calmly and also spend some time relaxing on my back for example. I'm now thinking it was the poison still left in my body, but for half my life I've just assumed I wasn't build for actually pushing my body through excercise or sports. I never felt like doing it and when I did do something it felt 'meh' most of the time. 

But tonight was different. I've been sober for two weeks now and my body was finally ready for a proper draining. I booked a slot at the local pool and I really went at it for over an hour. I'd do a couple of warm up laps using different groups of muscles at the speeds I was used to and then I did a lap where I pushed all of my muscles to the max. Of course I felt my muscles after an explosive lap, but it was no problem to continue this for over an hour. I used to be completely done after an hour without putting in even half the effort I did today. At the end I had to leave the pool because they were closing and when I got out I felt reborn and very much at ease.

When I got home I crawled out of my bathing suit (changing rooms are still closed here) and crashed on the couch. All the muscles I had used were so very happy and I started to get a tingly feeling all over.

And then it happened. The famed runner's high. Oh my god, a wave of intense euphoria completely washed over me. I felt so incredibly happy and relaxed. The only thing I could do was grin like an idiot with some tears of happiness running down my face. Holy shit, that was intense. Laughed out loud for no apparant reason as well. 

I learned the phrase ""high on life"" when I was like 16 and back then I had already been drunk and stoned. I thought it was some stupid hippie bullshit for pussies and never considered it a real thing. But the runner's high? Fucking hell, drugs have never come close to this. It most definitely is possible to get high on life!

Some real excercise after a couple weeks of detox? Highly recommended!

I hope the after effects will stay with me for another half an hour, because I'm now going to quickly wash away the chlorine before bed and I can't seem to worry about anything at the moment.

Whatever happens, I will sleep like a baby tonight! :D

Good night!

I drink everyday and have for 20 years. Today is day 6 for me. It isn’t my first day 6. There are of course, many reasons I’d like to quit, but a big one is my body. It feels like it’s giving out on me. I can barely move some days, my feet kill me, I have developed a “lean” when I walk to favor an area of my back that is so crunchy I can’t stand up straight. My muscles are so tight just putting on shoes is becoming somewhat of a problem. Bending, sitting, even sleeping. Everything hurts. 
I’m unsure how much of this is due other factors such as my age (48) and my job (bartender, just to make this a little harder!) but I’d imagine quite a bit of it is from hitting it hard for so many years. 
I’m not scared of quitting anymore like I used to be. I feel like I am finally ready. 

If any of y’all have inspiring tales of the magic that happens and the improvements in how your bodies feel, move, react, look, whatever! Your experience will help fuel my desire to slay the beast.

My summer is going to be crazy busy with social events, and I'm just so worried about it.

I’ve tried AA and it’s not really my thing and couldn’t stick with it. Every time someone would share I’d compare them to my life and tell myself “well I’m not that bad, so I’m good”. I don’t know what to say really other then Know I need help. I’ve lost 3 jobs due to drinking, not because I was passed out drunk but because what a sober me would let go the drunk me wouldn’t and I ran my mouth to everyone and anyone who would listen. Everything is always someone else’s fault in my drunk eyes, I can justify passing blame on anything while I’m drunk. 

I have a great job now but still struggle with being drunk, sober for a week then drunk half a fifth before I start the day and finish the other half as soon as I got time to get to my car. Drinking I know is ruining my life and knowing that I still struggle to stop. 

Right now I’m watching a hockey game and want to drink but would ruin my 2 days of being sober (or I feel it’s my guilt of being so wasted during the weekend I had to try to change for the 300th time)

The scary thing is a little bit of codeine or any stronger opiate takes the edge off completely just like 2-4 beers.   But that is more dangerous still than kratom or alcohol.

I think, “what would I even do with myself or how will I relax, let loose and enjoy my evening without it?”  I see the flaws in my thinking but it’s hard to actually combat in reality.

220,SPOILER ALERT - 6 months ago to the day since I posted here I entered a detox centre. I am a new person.,"I didn't really know why I posted it originally, I was just lost and things were continuing to spiral downhill.

[See here for original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k9ohge/i_almost_died_wrapping_my_car_around_a_pole/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Anyway, this escalated to the point of drinking almost a bottle of gin a day. Here was my routine:

\- Shot or 2 in the morning before the shower  
\- Pour 300 ml of Gin into a 700ML Juice Bottle  
\- Keep 'Juice' in Desk Draw, or plain sight and sip away all day.  
\- Constant strong chewing gum/cologne to mask any smell  
\- Visine for the Red Eyes  
\- Breathalyser to check BAC.   
\- If Over, check RBT Facebook Group in my area and dodge hot spots (bad I know). Uber if it's night-time.  
\- Arrive home and proceed to get blackout drunk.  
\- Wake up 4 AM fully clothed on top of my bed with crap food around me and some weird YouTube Rabbit Hole playlist muffled in the background.  
\- Scull 1.5 L of Water  
\- Toss and turn, hopefully sleep untill 7ish  
\- Repeat.

One month ago I signed myself into the waiting list for a detox centre and came out last week. Not going to lie, it was one of the most challenging things I have ever done and without a doubt the most rewarding. Withdrawals from alcohol can kill. Do it safely.

I came across and met people from all socio-economic, religious and racial environments. Some were there because they were forced to be and the minority were there because they wanted to get better. (People like me. And like YOU, if you're reading this).

I'll be honest, some people there are so far gone and don't wan't help. If you are on this sub, you're kind've admitting you're a bit fucked (maybe not as much as I am/was), which is the first step. Action it.

I have no craving whatsoever for alcohol now, where 2 weeks ago I was stealing bottles of whisky from my dads house. The heaven of possibilities with sobriety far outweighs the hell of continuing down the track of pouring alcohol over your trauma.

I guess this is a selfish post, but I'm writing it because if I can do it (one day at a time), anyone can!

I have been feeling like Brendan Coopers' character in Limitless, which again, is very cliche but I'm on top of the world and want you to be too!

Please hit me up with any questions or comments and I'd love to share any more of my experience if it helps.

Thank you all!",t3_o0h85t
221,Day 7 - scariest week of my life.,"I have been drinking two 8 packs of ""Earthquake"" 16 oz. (10.1 percent alc.) malt liquor beer every night for the past 3 years, basically just drinking to feel normal. A week ago I finally said enough was enough and woke up to no leftover beers from the night before (which I usually crack open right after waking up, if there WERE any left over). Made it 6 hours before I began convulsing, profusely sweating, dry heaving, and barely able to walk. Crawled my way into my living room where my roommates were and asked them to take me to the hospital. 


They dropped me off and I got the help I needed. The first 4 days were excruciatingly painful and I felt like death. But here I am on day 7 finally feeling back to what ""normal"" used to be before I started drinking. I've been lurking this sub for a year or so now and when I read the posts I think ""yeah, I'll get around to that mindset some day..."", and now I can truly say that I finally have, and I will NEVER drink again. Thank you everyone for your stories and inspiration. I love the feeling of being able to get a full nights rest without having to wake up every few hours to pee. I love the feeling of actually having an appetite again. I love the feeling of not having to worry about how I'm going to afford beer until the next payday.

I love the feeling of being free.

I want to value my time and do worthwhile, interesting things but have found myself numbing my mind with phone games instead - really not ideal. Do you guys have suggestions for pastimes?

I am 45 days sober. Anyone experience that too? 
I mean it might be the stress and excitement about moving to a new place soon and I don't know yet if I will get the apartment I want and if I will get financial support.

Instead of being obsessed with drinking I was obsessed with AA. In a weird way it felt like alcohol was still controlling my life even though I wasn’t drinking. Also, and this may just be the area I’m in, it was very heavily religious-specifically Christianity. Again, something else that works for a lot of people but just not me.

230,Two Weeks Down - Some things that have helped me get through and feel better,"I'm two weeks in and feeling pretty decent at the moment.  The initial intense craving and crap feeling has passed.  For the moment it's more about building a new kind of life and making sure I don't slip into old patterns when the going gets tough.  

I thought I'd share a couple of things that are helpful for me getting through each day and making changes in the way I view things.  These are not the kind of things to do when you've just started to quit and are feeling like crap.  These are things to do a bit later, when you're physically okay, but maybe just restless or down on yourself.  

1) Pick a manageable task and tackle it, preferably a thing that will improve your life.  It can be simple or more complicated.  Ideally, this is addressing a thing that bothers you all the time.   I'll give you a couple of examples.  

Easy example: Now don't think I'm gross but I live in the tropics and we have cockroaches.  It's not from being dirty, they just come in the house.  So for months, I've seen a bunch of yuck at the bottom of my cutting board cupboard, every time I open it.  Every time I saw it I thought, ""ugh disgusting"".  It seems like such a simple thought, but it was more, it was ""Ugh, disgusting.  My life is such a mess!!!  I'm drowning in this crap!""  So last night after dinner, I finally tackled it.  I took the cutting boards out, grabbed some Lysol wipes, and got rid of that (literal) shit.  It took less than five minutes to do this, and just a few wipes.  Low cost, low time investment.  Now the impact of this is greater than you might think.  I have a win, I did something, I took on a project.  When I open my cupboard, instead of thinking what a mess my life is, I can think, ""Ah, that looks so much better!  So glad I did that!  I'm not helpless.  I'm not useless.   I love the way this cupboard looks.""  

Harder example: Let's say you look in the mirror every day and you think, ""Look at me, I look terrible.  I'm a mess"".  Go get yourself a nice haircut.  

Anything that bothers you day after day is a great thing to do this on.  Huge impact.  One less thing to bother you; a sense of accomplishment; and the best part is that these little tasks and wins build momentum.  Start small and soon you have the effort to tackle something bigger.   Even better if you can take the worst thing you see and make it the best!!!!  

2) Nurture something.  For me, this is plants.  I do succulents.  I buy little cuttings, root them, love them day after day.  They are forgiving, they are beautiful, they will reward you with growth.  You can mess around with them for hours.  If anyone is interested in more information about this, I will be happy to share.  For me, it's a great place to get lost and is very rewarding.  It can be a slow change, but this is life, this is me too; I'm changing slowly.  And I'm trying to grow new roots and turning into something more beautiful and healthy.  

If you're really feeling brave, make it a kitten instead.  

3) Legos.  They have so many kits.  They will keep your hands busy.  They are solvable problems.  They require complete focus, and will take your mind away from your thoughts in the most beautiful of ways.  

I hope this helps someone out there.  I'm ready to tackle another week and keep putting some distance between me and my drunk self.

*always tell your doctor about your drinking/drugs, they don't care and it can help for any prescriptions/procedures*

14 year marriage,
No kids (our choice)
Well kept home, pets, hygiene, eat well, remember all occasions &amp; send the gifts. 
Do all of the things that need doing. Always.

I don't drink when I'm working, I am middle class, so while I can afford to buy the alcohol, I feel stupid for wasting my money on something so bad for me.

But, I like it.

I've brought up my drinking to friends, family, but no one sees it as a problem, largely because I'm a competent drunk.

Is there anyone here like me? How do I quit when it's only for me?

235,I'm 21. How am I supposed to meet people/make friends without going to bars?,"I've wasted my entire 21st year trapped in a dark room, addicted to Xanax, and not socializing or doing anything besides drink.

After my last OD, I decided I need to not drink any more, ever again. I've told myself this, but I have to do it because I realize I would end up dead, in prison, or homeless.

And what am I even supposed to make out of this life? I had goals to go to college and be writer before my mom passed away at age 16, my sister and all but one grandparent by 21, and PTSD, insomnia depression, anxiety, alcoholism and serious consideration of $uicide crippled me and left me unable to even shower or brush my teeth.

I'm also a social outcast now, because I made a fool of myself drunk and on drugs. I'd message girls vulgar shit which I really feel horrible out, and generally just made an ass out of myself. I deleted social media out of shame.

And how do I teach myself to stop drinking/do adult stuff? My mom was zonked out on painkillers and Xanax every day from 13-16, and my dad would leave for weeks at the time and did not speak to me much, so I was never really raised. 

I'm not sure if there are subs that can help me with these predicaments, but I really need help. I spent a year of my life drunk and on drugs after a S/A of 10 years, like everything caught up with me, all the trauma, bullying, beatings, a 4 year abusive relationship, loneliness etc. caught up with me and destroyed my life.

I'm waiting an hour and a half for my bank to close so I can't go impulsively get cash to purchase liquor. I really, really need help, at this point it's either adapt or die.

236,Day 10 possible break up after 6 yrs,"I’m on day 10 and I’m having a rough day. I’ve been really trying hard to connect with my partner of 6/7 years (whose counting?) we have an almost 1 year old daughter. We had an awesome weekend and I watched our daughter all day yesterday while he “went to school” I came to find out he didn’t do schoolwork and instead spent his day reading anime porn. This isn’t the first time I’ve caught him doing this shit l. I watch his daughter and contribute 50% of the bills while he jerks off to other women. 

I’ve definitely hidden my drinking and stuff but I feel so betrayed and foolish. I work while I watch our daughter so he can finish school and he constantly complains about not having enough time to finish his work so I do more.So I do the housework, grocery and all other shopping, and watch our daughter at least 40 hrs a week AND work. He would come home and put her to sleep and that’s when I’d start drinking.  

I tried to post in r/relationshipadvice and some douche looked into my history and made fun of how just yesterday I was posting about my 9th day of sobriety. I really feel like picking up but instead I’m gonna go to a hot yoga class. I’m a much better mom sober/not hungover.

With the amount I’m drinking, I’m afraid to even try not drinking a thing, bc I don’t know how bad the withdrawal might be, so I plan to only have 2-3 glasses, sipping slowly, and water in between. I just don’t trust myself to stick to that. Every morning that I’ve planned to do the same, I cave in the evening. I’m thinking that if I take a melatonin once I know I need to be going to sleep, then I won’t be tempted to sit in bed, reading random things on my phone, and downing more and more wine, which is what I always do after I’ve finished my nightly cleaning and showered. I know my husband is probably aware that I drink too much, but I’m too ashamed to actually admit it out loud. It’s sort of an unspoken thing, but if I say ok, I know I have a problem, and I need you to help keep me accountable, then it’s just…I don’t know. So I decided to come here (my first time even coming to this sub) and hopefully find support. I would like for tonight to be the start of a taper to end this dangerous habit.

If you read this far (it was long, I’m sorry), thank you. I’ve only just started reading these success stories, and it gives me hope.",t3_o0ircy

241,Went to Vegas over the weekend,"*And I didn't drink a single drop!*

(TLDR at bottom)

I spent the past four days with my brother in Vegas and surrounding national parks, two days in the parks, two days in Vegas. The parks and more nature-y things were easy to not drink cuz well... nature and no alcohol for miles. There was alcohol available at rest stops which did make me think about having a drink sometimes, however that was VASTLY overpowered by the need to drink water and make sure I stay hydrated. 


Vegas was a bit of different beast, admittedly not as bad as I thought it'd be though. Being stone cold sober and seeing all the drunk people stumbling Fremont St at night really made me think, reflect that I was once getting that drunk but not even in Vegas, just at home. I didn't want to be in a state that 90% of the people around me were in and it motivated me to not touch a drop. 


However, there was one time I did go to a bar and came close to drinking. I was thirsty, waiting for my brother, figured I'd go and see if they have any mocktails or non-alcoholic drinks. Figured it'd be no problem, just go up to the bar, sit on the stool, and enjoy a non-alcoholic drink. NOPE! Soon after I sat down, a tiny voice in my head started saying to grab a drink, ""it's only one"", ""come on you're in Vegas!"" I GTFO as soon as that urge to drink hit and wandered until I found I water fountain.


Surprisingly the hardest spot where I had the most cravings and temptation was the Mob Museum. It started with an ad they had by the ticket center advertising their homemade moonshine. I was flying out that day and thought ""Hey, I could pick up a small bottle to bring home with me and give to my dad."" Yeah that give quickly became get a big bottle and take it home for me. Walking through the halls, reading about prohibition, seeing all the booze bottles and old timey people having a good time drinking REALLY made me want to partake in the fun and have a drink too! Don't get me wrong, the museum was VERY cool and interesting, I would recommend checking it out to anyone who interested in true crime and mobs. It was hard walking through the first exhibit area though and being surrounded by all these positive enforcements for booze. I was still able to enjoy the museum and even though I was dealing with the thought of drinking shouting into my ear, it only helped convince me that no, I should not pick up a drink.


Anyway, thank you for reading and IWNDWYT!

I was so excited (still am) but I had the worst day Ive probably had all year. It sucked. I cried. I raised my voice. I laid in bed. It didnt go AT ALL how I thought my seven months would go. I like to make big deals out of every month anniversary to keep myself on track so it really hurt my feelings it didnt go well. 

But heres the thing. I didnt drink about it. And yes the thought did cross my mind for a split second. 

Life isnt all rainbows. You WILL have bad days. That's a promise. But its what you do with those days that counts in sobriety. Use your toolbox. Reach out. Breathe. Cry it out. 

But dont drink.

Trying to identify what was setting me off and I was definitely having a lot of overwhelming emotions about “nothing”.  I was tired all day, worked out after work  and it was lackluster, and I’m exhausted, and feeling fat and over this whole thing.

250,"Day 3 on vacation, drinks flowing.....","Lots of beer and pretty mixed drinks, but I’ve stuck with NA beers and water.  I don’t like Heineken the beer much but their 0.0 is pretty good for an NA beer.   Not much selection so it was with reluctance that I picked it up, and I’m pleasantly surprised.  I’m with family who aren’t, by normal standards, “heavy” drinkers but they do have multiple drinks a day.  When you’re not drinking, you really notice that those afternoon and evening drinks others have really add up.  It’s been great to wake up feeling awesome, hit the gym early, and have energy to burn all day.  Also, all those extra calories I would have spend on beer can go towards fancy coffee drinks and other occasional splurges.

I was nervous telling my parents I was not having beers this vacation.  I’m an older guy (not far from 50) so it seems strange that I would even care, but I usually hang out and have beers with my dad.  I didn’t need to go into details, just saying I’ve taken a break recently and feel much better so I’m keeping it going.  No pressure or nothing from them, so it’s fine.  To be honest, I really don’t miss them at all and I have no desire to drink.  I do like my cannabis, though, but I’m such a light user that I’m set after just a little bit.  I know this topic is controversial here, but I have no desire to put a label on myself.  My goal is just to avoid the massive downside that alcohol inevitably brings with it.",t3_o0m2bo

256,Two months today. Almost didn't make it,"So today is two full months since I've hit my last threshhold and gained the change in perspective needed to save my life from further ruin.

First I want to say thank you to all of you who are here on this sub.  All the long time posters and new posters whose posts i haven't read yet.  All the lurkers whose eyes make our perspectives visible.  You all make this place exist.

The highs and the lows.

The highs.

1. Clarity of mind is something to be cherished.  I've been taking b12 vitamins and reading and learning things.  Starting to feel smart again.
2. Relationships are becoming more sincere.  It's easier to see other people's needs and be tentative and empathic. 
3. I've lost almost 15lbs of weight.  I knew I was overweight, but didn't think I had that much just bloat on me.  Still weak, flabby and out of shape.
4. Pancreatitis is almost all but gone, once in a while I'm reminded of it if I eat too much spicy or vinegary food. 
5. Sleep deprivation torture has been cancelled.   Loud cats are still loud, loud noises outside the window are still there, roommates are still slamming doors, the ice machine is still loud.  But I sleep better than I can ever remember and can wake up at 6:30am every morning, refreshed and ready to tackle the world.

The lows.

1. Depression is still here.   The medicine is gone, so the pain is very real.
2. Self awareness and self esteem issues.  When you're an awkward teenager, and then get into drinking to fit in, you end up growing into an awkward adult.
3. Recovery is actually very fragile if not reinforced.

I almost drank yesterday and today.  

Got some unexpected bad outcomes with regard to my driving privilege reinstatement.  Even though it wasn't my fault, I felt like I've wasted people's time.  And now I'm worse off financially and have more responsibilities and less freedoms.   Told my SO that I felt like it wasn't worth it and I felt like giving up.  

I felt really strong the entire time since quitting, until yesterday. Quickly realized i don't have the coping mechanisms to deal with setbacks like this.  Was contemplating what I was going to drink and how much.

Today I got more bad news.  Once again I'm allowing a predatory company influence my mental well being.  Feel like skipping out on my group meeting today, just can't handle having to talk about it.

257,9 days sober today,I’m hoping by posting here someone can relate to the self loathing I’ve been experiencing for years. My whole life has been flipped upside down in the last four days due to my own selfishness and stupidity. I’ve hurt the most important people in my life and no one hates me more than I hate myself right now. Feeling lost without the stability I’ve known.

258,Hi everyone; I’m 4 days sober. Nice to meet you.,"I’m probably not really much of a special case. I, however, feel that I am. I’m one of those girls who no one would ever suspect had a budding alcohol problem. 

Yes, I’m in college, so yes, I would binge drink every weekend, but I would never classify myself as having a problem with it. If anything, I thought it was an elixir that came with side effects that were tolerable once or twice to week. 

This past semester, I would binge drink at least 3 days out of the week, with the sole intention to be extremely drunk, but I would drink a gallon of water every day and would never feel the negative effects of a hangover. 

Having dealt with horrible hangovers in the past, I was satisfied; I had found a solution to the sole negative aspect of my occasional pastime, a pastime that made me feel comfortable putting myself out there with boys, a pastime that brought me closer to my roommates, and a pastime that allowed me to have more fun than I ever could sober. 

The effects creeped in so gradually that I can’t even pinpoint when I truly began to have a problem. As my tolerance climbed, the first signs manifested themselves in fights due to pent up frustration with my roommates, ones in which I said horrible things that I couldn’t recall the next morning. 

Still, I didn’t think I had a problem. Nor did they. It was just a couple of out of character events that did not shape who I was, or who I was becoming. Just a few out of control nights. But gradually, those few nights of picking fights turned into a handful. My roommates became less forgiving, less able to justify my actions. Still, it wasn’t a problem, I told myself, just a rough couple of weeks. 


Alcohol could never be an issue for me; this was my main narrative. It was a tool for fun and closeness; for shared nights of laughter and happiness.


At the end of the semester, one characterized by weeks of binge drinking, I felt resolved. I apologized to my housemates for anything I had said to them while inebriated, and they seemed to truly forgive me. I was just someone who had a couple of rough weeks, and I convinced myself — and them— that the underlying issue wasn’t alcohol; it was anxiety, and a lack of communicative skills. 


Going home to a sister who has struggled with 5 years of alcoholism, then, didn’t seem to be an obvious issue for me; after all, I didn’t have a problem. I had just had a two week rough patch. 

Well, given that we both don’t have any plans lined up for the summer, we began to drink recreationally, starting in the morning and taking naps in between swigs of Pink Whitney. Our parents never noticed; so, how bad could it really be? 

Deep down, I knew that my parents were so deeply aware of my sister’s struggle with alcoholism that they would always be way too focused on her to notice that anything was up with me. This became harder to justify when my older sister left for 2 weeks, and I, 20 years old, found myself frantically searching for ways to get alcohol. 

I had put myself on dating apps, and I somehow convinced myself that seeing any boy while being sober would not be a version of me that was fun or attractive; it would, rather, be one that was boring, shy, and seemingly incapable of letting loose. As a result, I asked my friends with fake IDs to buy me alcohol, lying that I was having a small get together and didn’t want my parents to find out. The lying had begun, but It would be a one time thing. 

I don’t like to lie. 

I’ll be honest next time. 

They acquiesced. It’s summer; it probably seemed innocent enough. I met up with boys, I seemed fun, carefree, and they didn’t seem to notice that I showed up tipsy to the dates/ hook ups. Things were still going great; and I, the awkward tall girl, felt wanted and desired, for one of the first times in my life. 

Alcohol, to me, was merely a means to the end of feeling wanted, of gaining some dating experience under my belt. It could never become a true issue. 


Well, all that changed when I went on a week long bender, drinking heavily every day, not realizing that I had slowly, unconsciously, begun to become dependent on the poison. 

During this week, I saw a guy who I liked, but hadn’t gotten to know too well, and I scared the shit out of him and disrespected him by showing up to his house incoherent. 

That hadn’t been the plan. 

I just had a few swigs earlier in the day, and by the time the hang out rolled around, I had gotten more drunk than I intended. 

Still, I took a couple more swigs for my courage against a guy who I had convinced myself was too good for me, one whose confidence I sought to match.

 I hate that I can’t remember how I looked. 

Did I apply deodorant, perfume? 

I was too drunk to know. 

But if alcohol was the elixir to men liking me, surely it won’t allow me to avoid effort. 

It did. I went as far as hiding a bottle under his bathroom sink so I could leave periodically to take swigs of it. 

You see, alcoholics stutter when they begin to think they are this smart. 

That no one will ever notice. 

I had reached this point without even realizing. I had accidentally blacked out, so I don’t even remember how I acted, or what set him off. But he suddenly asked me to leave, after being quite interested after our first encounter. 

Why? 

What had I done? 

I’m not visibly drunk.  

That can’t be why. 

So it must be about me. 

He’s been leading me on, how could he kick me out right after sex and not explain why? 

Even sex can’t make me attractive. 

In my incoherent mind, these must have been the swirling thoughts. Because all I remember next is wanting to cry, wanting to yell, wanting to call him an asshole for kicking me out. 

Instead, I begged. 

“Why don’t you like me?” My alcohol drugged brain quickly turned angry, “is this about my race? Is this about how I look?” 

The truth is, he was more than justified in asking me to leave. Clearly, my selfish actions and the way I began acting in his apartment scared him and made him uncomfortable. 

But I would never believe that; I wasn’t even that drunk! But I was… I yelled and cried, slammed his door. Then, in my drunken stupor, I cried on the curb of his apartment. I didn’t even know why I was crying; I was too drunk to truly process what I had just done or what had happened. In this moment, I should’ve saved my last shred of dignity, slept it off and gone home. My parents were already angry; I had been leaving at late hours of the night to see people they didn’t know. Still, I didn’t think they suspected alcohol was involved, and my bravado only surmounted. 

What I did next led up to my rock bottom, which was already in the making. These events were the catalyst to me realizing that I can never touch alcohol again. I begged a guy I barely knew, one I had only met once, to come pick me up. If alcohol was good for anything, it was male attention. It must be; I don’t drink before dates for any other reason than the confidence it instills. 

Well, he came to get me. And in my drunkenness , I called my best friend’s mom, crying about what had happened in his car. He rubbed my shoulder. I hadn’t even been wronged, I was merely a victim of my insidious, toxic addiction. 

Let me pick you up, she said. Sleep here. 
No, I’m okay; I’m with a guy I trust. 

At this point, I was beyond my limit. I was not anywhere close to thinking clearly, and I felt I had nothing to lose now that I had ruined things with a guy who is probably great, but I’ll never get to know. 

Never mind, I want to go home. 
This kind guy, who picked me up in my drunken stupor, had to sit there as I called back my friend’s mom and frantically said: Come pick me up. I need to leave.

Did something happen? I thought you were with someone you trusted? 
No, I need to leave. 

I refused to look at him during this, forcing him to note the selfishness that my destructive tendencies were causing. He didn’t deserve to deal with this; I barely knew him. He had been nothing but kind to me. This isn’t who I was, but in that moment, I was not who I am. When my friend’s mom got there, I rushed out, no goodbye. In my haste, I dropped a bottle of liquor on his apartment floor, one I had been trying to conceal.  
I’m so sorry. I have to go. 

I rushed out. My friend and her family carried me to the car, clearly beyond concerned. 

Were you drugged? What happened? 
I don’t know. I don’t know. 
I could barely process how to breathe; that was my only focus. 
Please don’t tell my parents. They don’t even know I drink. 

Reflecting on this, asking people to lie for me, is another instance of when I realized that I may have a problem. Before, no one else had to conceal anything; I didn’t have a problem, so my parents would never notice. I was too good of a daughter; too perfect of a child. 

By the time we reached their house, my inebriation was so high that I just began sobbing uncontrollably into the lap of my best friend’s dad. Yelling at them for calling the cops, because they feared I may have been raped. Yelling at them for caring for me, when I was clearly at the beginning of a downward spiral. 

The next morning, still intoxicated, I texted the boy who I ruined things with. Please never reject a girl like that. I don’t know what I was thinking; he had every right to do so. He probably thinks I led him on, and then suddenly flipped a switch the next time I saw him. Who would want to put up with that; why should he need to? He never owed me anything. He was weirded out by my sudden attachment to him, which had occurred during my one week bender. 

All of the weird texts I had sent to him weren’t written or composed in my right state of mind. I had no right to send a text because I made him uncomfortable, and he understandably blocked me. 

The aftermath of these effects were a two day stint of alcohol withdrawal; accompanied by me in my hazed state assuring myself that I could never touch it again. I could never treat anyone like that. Even perfect strangers. 

The two days were horrible. I didn’t even know I could withdraw from something I never knew I had slowly become addicted to. I had suicidal ideations, although I had never been suicidal. But, alcohol was supposed to be my elixir? Why did I feel this way? 

All of my friends were blindsided; rightfully so, when I texted them in a haze that I’m not myself, and that I’m worried I might do something horrible. I concinced them that these thoughts were NOT how I truly felt, but rather a result of the misinformed decisions I had made in the weeks leading up. 

I went to bed, hallucinating spiders on the wall, having terrifying 30 second nightmares every time I shut my eyes. The worst of it all was a seizure, when I shook uncontrollably in the middle of the night, my only fear of the moans that my parents might hear. I hallucinated that my dad was running toward me, and I thought my life as I knew it was over. 

I can get past this, I told myself; as long as my parents don’t know. They’ll never forgive me. Needless to say, I’ve sought help. Today I went to my primary care physician, told him how my anxiety led to this bender, and cried in the process.

I cried that it took me getting here to help myself. And to realize that this had been a long time in the making. 

I never plan on drinking again; I know I’m better than this, but now I have events to contend with that make me feel horrible, and people out there who know a version of me that is not who I am. 

I’ve always read, no one sets out to become an alcoholic. 

Of course they don’t. I never did. I never thought it could be me. It’s a poison that quietly strips you of your logical thinking and faculties, and you only notice that you’re an alcoholic when you utterly embarrass yourself or ruin opportunities with potential friends.

268,Today is my day 10,"11 days back my life came crashing down. Hiding my drinking from everyone, and uncontrollably drinking more and more each day, finally caught up to me in a big and disastrous way. 

From the help of a very loving wife, and through being unconditionally open and honest with myself and her, being completely vulnerable, admitting to myself finally that I’m an alcoholic and incapable of drinking safely, to then reaching out to family and close friends to share with them and ask for their support, and now attending meetings and taking online relapse prevention courses, through all of that I have made it 10 days and life is starting to slowly round the corner for me. 

Thank you to everyone in this amazing community for sharing their own stories and supporting my journey. It’s been incredible. 

Standing tall and strong with each and every one of you.

269,What are your 'first sober night' rituals?,"I know this is a moot question for many people on here because often the first night is spent in hospital detoxing, but for those that are able to detox at home... what do you do to psych yourself up for THAT particular day to be the one where you don't drink.

I used to find that first day comparatively easy. If I wanted to not drink enough, I could. But 6 years down the line, I want to not drink every day, however once it comes to decision time I always chose drinking. Just looking for any advice that can make me chose to not drink, despite the anxiety.",t3_o0pwti
270,Just hit 1 month!!,"I just did it, and im feeling a lot better, its not the easiest time tho, we just broke up with my gf,  can't say im not thinking a lot about drinking to make things easier, but i know its just a lie because when im hangover actually everythings way harder. i try to stay with you guys for a long time!",t3_o0iv3b
271,It's not easy but it's worth it.,"I've had a bit of a whinge today.

I've been busy, had a lot of family obligations that I kind of really didnt feel like going to. I've had a bit of a whinge about how the bar had two shit alcohol free options etc etc

I've been whinging about many things but I need to just come here and check myself before I wreck myself...

It is soo fucking worth it! Oh god all the difficult little uncomfortable situations I've faced the last couple of weeks are all so worth it. I dont want to drink. I'm learning how to do hard things without a drink. 

I'm waking up feeling normal and healthy every single day! 

This is totally worth it. I'm so grateful to be sober.",t3_o0ldxu
272,How do you practice self-control when it feels like the world is spinning out of control?,"Living through the political turmoil of the past decade and a global pandemic has made my attempts to cut down my drinking completely futile. I've taken steps to take control of my own life, but it sometimes feels like the world around me has gone completely off the rails and there's nothing I can do to stop it. So many of my friends and family have morphed into 24/7 angry, bitter people in the past few years, and it's hard not to follow in their foot steps.",t3_o0r1tz

274,Feeling alright but left out.,"So after sometime I decided to go sober again and it’s been really good for me. I’m drinking more water, Trying too eat healthy, just feeling physically and mentally better. I’m 7 days sober and the alcohol culture around in the city is REAL and I feel left out because things finally open up and people are out drinking at patios and hanging with friends which nowadays is possible. But I’m just surrounded by it at home my moms an alcoholic and my brother is not but he drinks too and my co workers are talking about all this fun and tbh it’s my fault for abusing it when I was down bad in a depressive self medicating spiral and my pancreas levels are somewhat abnormal.. smh BUT.. ☝🏼IWNDWYTD.",t3_o0tb7u
275,I had the dream!,"You guys were not kidding. The dream where I started drinking again hit me last night, just after a couple weeks sober. I woke up this morning bracing for the sickness...but it never came! Goodness, that was an overwhelming feeling to wake up with. Can't believe just less a little over two weeks ago that was real. I am still feeling the fear of that dream hours later.

So grateful to not be drinking. Thanks for the support, everyone.",t3_o0m38g

278,Is it fair to be angry over new roommate's drinking,"So, I've been sober since August 2016. I'm in a good place with my sobriety. I live in a three bedroom house with two other guys.

My one roommate and I have lived here for about 5 years. We got a new roommate a couple months ago. He told us he was currently living in a sober living home, but wanted to move out. He told us he was involved in a job training program through the home that he was staying enrolled in. He said he'd probably have to move in incrementally since he still needed to love at the sober house for a few weeks.

I told him when we met him that im a recovering alcoholic. He didn't want to say why he was being treated, and I just left it at that. He seemed like an alright dude.

Well, he moved in immediately and then it became apparent he did not have a job or was enrolled in a program. He started spending his days smoking weed and drinking in the living room. Id say he spends more time smoking weed than drinking. 

So, my issue is that it kind if pissed me off to see him drinking. Im not feeling an urge to drink, it just makes me angry that he's doing it in the open like this.

It feels like someone going to an AA meeting, then pulling out a flask to drink from while sharing that they haven't had a drink in a month. 

The last new roommate we had didn't know I was an alcoholic and offered me some wine once. I said no thanks but I dont drink. I never saw him with a bottle around the house after that. I think he assumed I was an alcoholic. Regardless, that didn't bother me because he didn't know me and as far as I knew he had no issues of substance abuse. 

I guess it just feels disrespectful in a sense. Like, I feel like if someone tells you they are an alcoholic, maybe at least ask if its a problem to see others drinking it.

On the other hand, he's also been kind of a shitty roommate overall. So I feel like maybe I'm inflating this situation from my frustrations over like everything else he does.",t3_o0hyuf
279,Off to detox today.,"I'm really happy about this. I can finally start my counter. Not that I really want to pay attention to that, I just want to start it.

281,Day 3 - What are some benefits to look forward to?,"I made a post yesterday, but deleted it due to feeling nervous. So, I'm trying again today with something different.

Like the title says, I'm wondering what benefits there are to look forward to - outside of just not feeling hungover. What changes did you experience, and when did they start to happen?",t3_o0q4hp
282,The username says it all.,"Yesterday as I suffered through yet another brutal hangover and a wasted morning hanging over the toilet burping/gagging/retrieving my late-night fast food snacks from the depths of belly hell, I decided it's fucking time.

I downloaded This Naked Mind and started listening. After about 13\~ months of lurking this sub and seeing that book come up day after day, **jfc I feel silly because Annie is brilliant.** I am on the spectrum and have severe ADHD paired not so lovingly with PTSD. Those are things I have to deal with regardless of whether I am drinking, so let's stop the flow of the liquid poison, eh?

I want to be good/productive at my job again. I want to feel my age of 29 and not like a 94 year old rotting tomato who can't jog for more than a block despite growing up a major athlete. I want to not reach for Propranolol at 2AM because my heart feels like it's going to pop.  I want to stop justifying my drinking and allowing my shame to drive this bus. (The shame is the fucking worst, can we talk about that??) I want to stop drinking alone with my anxiety/intrusive thoughts that only grow more vicious with each beer I open.

Made this account to check-in and really dive-into this journey.  I treated myself to some Starbucks (haven't properly grocery shopped in at least a year, let alone *ate the damn groceries purchased).* Made my bed, tidied my WFH area and lit a candle. Next I will make my task list for the day and get started.

283,"My brain knows ""one day at a time"" is a trick","I've been really struggling to put together a long sober streak for a while, and I have a classic case of overwhelm from the idea of never drinking again. I sort of think, there's no way I can not drink EVER AGAIN, so I may as well just drink now.

I know the classic answer to this is to take it one day at a time--I won't drink today. But tomorrow is the same thing, and the day after that, and ultimately it ends up being able never drinking again. I know I'm way overthinking this but I can't help it. The day-at-a-time thing just hasn't clicked. Are there any strategies for getting to that place or does it just take time and perhaps greater conviction?",t3_o0jha2
284,I blacked out again last night.,"I’m in bed, shaking and nauseous with my head and heart pounding. I’m sick of waking up the morning after feeling like this. I’m sick of not being able to stop drinking once I’ve started. I’m sick of drowning my trauma in alcohol.

288,"When rock bottom wasn’t deep enough, I kept digging.","

So this may be long but I need to vent. I’ll start by saying I’ve always had a drinking problem. I’ve known for many, many years now but I’ve never been able to stop. I was arrested for underage drinking, public intox, and dui before the age of 25. Fast forward to last year. Right as the pandemic began I was lucky enough to secure a gig living and working on a farm in NorCal. This was my dream job and I loved it. Lived on top of mountains away from everything. A few months in my ex girlfriend who I am deeply in love with started communicating with me again and eventually confessed she still loved me and wanted to be with me again. I was ecstatic. We had always been in love with each other but something always got in the way. We first met when I was 20 and we fell in love quick. This was ten years ago. It ended because of my drinking and my behavior while drunk. I never forgave myself. Always told myself I would never let that happen again. Anyways I get her to come stay with me on the farm and it’s beautiful. We both had drinking problems and we’re going to quit together.Then my grandmother suddenly died. This devastated me. She was my closest family member. This made it difficult to quit drinking. Wasn’t able to do it. She had also left me her house in my home state so my girlfriend and I drove back home to live there. At first it was ok. No problems to speak of. We started slowing down our drinking but didn’t stop. About a month after we got back something terrible happened. I got a 2nd dui. This was the worst possible thing that could happen. I was fitted with a scram bracelet for about a month. During this time my gf is being supportive but can’t stop drinking. She says she doesn’t know how else to deal wi things. This begins a trend of her going out to bars more and more often, and staying out later and later and even into the next day. I begin losing patience with this. I need her support and love. We start getting into arguments every weekend. She feels like she has every right to do what she pleases and I’m hurt by it because I feel abandoned by her. She’s always sorry and promises to do better but nothing changes. I’ll admit I wasn’t handling my dui well and was also dealing with my grandmothers death. I was sapped of all positivity and wasn’t much fun to be around. I became a recluse. Everyone I knew drank so I alienated myself from them. I was tired of being lonely and bored. I relapsed hard. I started going to bars with my gf because I didn’t know how else to spend time with her. She didn’t like being at the house all the time. Then the drunken arguments began. I started saying and doing things that I would never do sober. Never violent but just say shit I shouldn’t say. The next day we would make up, but this started happening more and more. The resentment and built up frustration would come out. I hated the bars and didn’t like that I had no other way to spend time with her. Finally it happened one too many times. I had promised her I wouldn’t fuck up and be a belligerent asshole again, yet I stupidly drank with her at a bar again expecting a different result. She insisted we go to a house party after the bar had closed. I begged her to just go home and she refused. We argue well into the next day. Eventually it ends and we fall asleep together for the last time. She doesn’t talk to me for days. During this time I also blow a violation in my interlock. I’ve been out on bail for five months and now I’ve just put myself at risk of violating bond conditions. Right after this I decide i have to be sober . It’s to late though. My gf tells me it’s over. She is going to stay in the house because she promised me to look after it and my cat while I’m in jail. She tells me she loves me and always will but can’t do this anymore. I’m beyond ashamed and heartbroken. I had to quit my job because I can’t sleeep or eat. I haven’t for a week. All of this happened over eight months. I went from being on top of the world to being in the worst pain of my life. All because of alcohol. I have court in a few hours. I may be in jail by the end of the day. I hate myself beyond comprehension. I have no idea what life holds for me in the future. All I know is booze has no part in it.

Edit: ignore my counter. I’ve been sober again for 9 days.",t3_o0avn9
289,Selfcare and wine??!?!?!?!?!!?,"Pisses me off so much! Listening to the radio they're talking about how people have had a health awakening during the pandemic. And I initially lumped myself in with this thinking, ofcourse my sobriety is the biggest form of selfcare I've ever taken on. 
The radio host says ""people are making more time for excercise, meditation, skincare, mindfulness, yoga, having a wine""

I was like WTF how is everybody so brainwashed by this absolute bullshit. 

Sit with a face mask and have a wine. Do one good thing while poisoning yourself with jet fuel. 
Yes I have done that in the past but I know better now. I'm just thinking how absolutely wild it is for the radio to broadcast to a country of 5 million that you can lump in 'having a wine' as self care...the ironic thing is that literally the segment before this they were talking about methamphetamine addiction and alcoholism. 

Anyway that annoyed me so much.

296,5 days sober. SO decided to leave. What do,"I'll do my best to keep this concise. I've been drinking heavily on and off for about 3 years. My SO leaving me the first time was what drove me to stay sober for my longest stint (May-October of 2020), but when she came back I slowly (not really) slipped back into drinking. I drank around my work schedule (2 days on, 2 days off, 3 days on, 2 days off, repeat) so I'd handle my business and then just stay absolutely trashed until I had to return to work until 5 days ago when I went through the withdrawals and got off it.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember my childhood friend saying something to me the first time she left. He said, ""wooden\_knife, if this isn't your rock bottom then I don't know if you'll ever have a rock bottom."" I was doing really well for those \~5 months. I had plans to quit my job, move states back to my parents house and return to college. Then SO came to ""check up"" on me, saw me winning, and I took her back.

&amp;#x200B;

I really care about her deep down, I know if I fight for her to come back she probably will. The thing is, she seemed to be doing well when she moved back in but she's been in a funk for like 6 months. She keeps saying she's going to find a job, which she has been attempting the last couple weeks but she can't find one. We had this codependency thing when I was in the depths of alcohol the past few months. If I got alcohol, I'd take her to her favorite stores and let her buy a bunch of junk food. She'd smash all of it and then throw most of it up. (She's a tiny 110 lb girl but she eats like a horse) Rinse and repeat every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically now that I'm sober I told her what's up. I have no savings even though I make good money, half because I blew a lot of it on alcohol and half because of her eating disorder and her not working or helping out with any bills at all for the past 6 months. I wasn't trying to shame her about it in any way but my point was that I'm working on my addiction, so you need to be working on your eating too. She retorts with, ""I'm bored, okay?"" And I paused and said, ""If you're that bored then go get a job."" She's literally been holed up in my apartment for months, only leaving to go for jogs at night or occasionally visiting her mom. My response was enough to make her pack up some clothes and act like she was leaving. She wound up sitting in her car for an hour or so and then coming in to go to bed. I told her ""If that's all it took for you to just pack your shit and walk then this relationship has no chance of working out."" She never responds to these kinds of things, she just gets quiet and says she's moving out, or she's had enough, etc. She left her key here and now she's at her mom's place, waiting for me to beg for her to come back.

&amp;#x200B;

I need some advice on this. I live a pretty isolated life, I just work and come home. I have work friends but no one to really lean on, and my best friend from work is what I would consider to be an alcoholic as well so I kind of stopped going over to his place.

299,I need advice on how to quit.,"So, I've always struggled with alcohol.  

Alcoholism runs in my family. My dad was an alcoholic until he got esophageal cancer, then became hooked on opiates, then literally died in the ditch of a methadone overdose. 

Being home so much due to Covid has really kicked up my drinking habit. 

The last time I was 'bad' wasn't this bad. But I remember how frustrating and scary it was to feel like I had no control. I'd wake up regretting the night of drinking the night before. I'd swear I was going to quit, and then by 5 pm I was going to buy three Steel Reserve 2/11s. And I know that isn't a lot for some people, but the thing is, maybe that is enough but maybe I drink that and it isn't enough, it is never enough, and I go drive drunk to get more alcohol.  Really a coin toss for me. 

I tried to go to AA. Thing is, I am a very clean cut, professional looking person. I have a handsome face. I look ten years younger than I actually am. I guess, because of my look, it was clear that no one at AA even took my habit seriously. 

They treated me like someone who was just kind of 'touring' their lifestyle/struggles. Sponser was younger than me, by ten years, not very long sober, and any time I tried to talk to him, he'd just say 'work the steps.' Which I fucking know working the steps is how you get clean and sober, but fuck, if that's all the advice you got I can train a parrot to do everything you do as a sponsor.

And I get it, I am pretty functional as far as alcoholics go... no DUIs or anything. But just because I've gotten lucky and just because most of the time I stayed at home, doesn't mean I am not intimately familiar with how cold tile soothes drunken nausea. It doesn't mean I haven't had to apologize to my wife, time and time again, looking at her heartbreak and disappointed eyes. 

Doesn't mean I'm not struggling with alcoholism.

So, I stopped going to AA after about a month. If anything, the experience was making me feel more inclined to get hammered.

So, after that I started driving a semi for a living. Can't really drink and drive a semi. Not even at night. So, I used that line of work to put hard limits on my drinking. I'd drink once a week, when I had a day off for a reset. Get a hotel, go to a bar, whatever. Because you can't legally have alcohol, even unopened, in a big rig. 

Then, Covid hit. Stayed home to keep my daughters and keep them from bouncing between babysitters and getting exposed a lot.. And then I just kind of got stuck at home after school started back.

Without the gorey details, over time, my alcoholism is back in full swing. 

Me and my wife noticed that if I quit for a day or two, I'd end up caving, then it would be a really really bad binge, where my worst behaviors come out.

So, I find out about Delta 8 marijuana. I've never been able to smoke Marijuana, because it makes me super paranoid, but I hear delta 8 doesn't. I know that CBD and Marijuana can help deal with other substance abuse problems. So I give delta 8 a go. 

Honestly, delta 8 has been super helpful... to a point. I have cut my alcohol consumption in half. But... unfortunately, half is still way too much. To frame it, I still drink a bottle of wine per night in alcohol, roughly. (Though, the form of alcohol may be beer or wine or whatever.)

Other than that, my mood has significantly stabilized throughout the day. I had gotten to the point where any problem could set off my anxiety so bad that I would have to go have a drink or two to calm my nerves. Now, I don't have that anxiety. 

Now, I know that it is ill-advised to replace one substance with another. But, at this point, I'm just doing what I can to limit the control alcohol has.  I intended to wean myself off. And I have, because I barely even get a buzz from alcohol these days. 

But, I still have that need to drink. Just 'a little bit' every day. I mean, other than my health and my wealth, the drinking isn't really affecting anything else in my life. I mean, I'd consider it to be pretty well managed at this point. 

But I don't want it to be managed. I want to not need to drink. I want to be able to say, ""No thanks, I don't drink."" I want my wife to be proud of that, and not be afraid I'm going to eventually kill myself with this. 

So, I'm posting this asking for literally any advice beyond, ""Go to AA. Work the steps.""

I know most will probably condemn my use of delta 8 as a crutch. Please don't. I know, but again, we're at a point of damage control. 

I feel like if I could ever make it through one week without drinking, I might be able to do it. Made it two days, so far.",t3_o0km5w
300,What do you guys do?,"Been sober for a little over a month. Whenever I even as much as think about drinking, I grab a cup of coffee. Unfortunately caffeine has taken the place of alcohol. 

What do you do when the thought pops into your head?",t3_o0mp26
301,So it turns out alcohol was ruining my relationships,"Stop me if you've heard this before: I dont drink enough to cause a problem. I'm not an angry drunk, in fact I'm very sociable and friendly. I've never almost lost my job, got a DWI, or had a bad argument because of my drinking. No one has ever told me they thought I had a problem. The worst social repercussions I've experienced were 'beer fear' that I said something stupid or made a fool of myself dancing. Or so I'd thought.

It's been about 2.5 weeks since my last drink, but I've been mostly sober for the past few months. (It's been a slow process with a lot of stumbling blocks.) And one thing I've really noticed the past few days is how much better my everyday relationships are. I'm spending so much more time with my family. I'm happier and more relaxed, not to mention witty. I thought I was funny before, but now I'm totally on fire!

When I was drinking I would isolate myself in my room. I didnt want people to know, especially those close to me, when I was using and how much. That had a trickle down effect. Even when not drinking, there was an emotional distance caused by the secret keeping, the hiding... the lying. I spent so much emotional energy on planning how I was gonna sneak out and get some booze, what my cover story was, and how to dispose of the bottles. 

Now, I dont have to hide any part of myself from my family. I dont tense up when my mum comes in my room, wandering if she can smell it or I've left a bottle out by accident. I'm eager to do fun family things because I'm not peeved that they're interrupting my solo drinking time. I'm in such a better mood that I'm not picking fights over small things or being overly sensitive. 

I know these are probably all things you've read here before, and if you're like me, it probably kind of annoyed you. ""Being sober is so great for everyone else, why does it suck for me?"" - me, approx 5 days ago.

I'm not gonna lie, there are still some rough patches. The first few days after each relapse sucked. I was moody, irritable, lethargic. I loathed people who told me to stick it out, that it will get better. That was cold comfort from inside the trenches.

I'll offer an amended saying: it will get better, if you let it. If you focus on how much you miss alcohol, sorry but sobriety is gonna suck. But if you turn your face towards the metaphorical light, look at the small good things you've got, like cracking more jokes or not worrying about alcohol on your breath, or even that you didnt go against your own better judgement today, even if that's all you did, it will get better. The small wins pile up. They start to outweigh the losses.

I am lucky. Im getting out of alcohol before it got bad. But just because my rock bottom was relatively shallow, doesn't mean there were no negative effects. Just because your drinking isnt as bad as it could be, doesn't mean you have to accept it. You have the power to change your life. It will get better, if you let it.

302,"30 years spinning, 101 days in the clear","Yesterday I turned 30, surprisingly, coincidentally tallying 100 days sober to the mark!

Third stint of this many consecutive days sober, ca. 2 trimesters shy of doing my previous record in! But the third is the charm, right? 

I can now boast that I quit drinking in my twenties, feels too good a bragging-right to hand in my newfound freedom from depending on the booze, to naively welcoming a shitty, chemical rollercoaster to take reign of my wellbeing again;

303,New to the group and new to sobriety,Hi all - I’ve been trying to quit on my own for months but it’s been so demoralizing each time I drink. I’ve started going to counseling and I think it’ll help. I only just discovered this group - I really like how you all support each other. That makes me feel hopeful. Thanks.,t3_o0inw1
304,Relapsed again this past weekend,"Every weekend I've been relapsing after I promise myself I won't drink again and each time the regrets are getting worse. I previously had almost 9 months sober but I've been drinking again since around March of this year and now I'm driving buzzed and blacking out etc and doing dumb things again and I made this account to hold myself accountable before I end up daily drinking like I did in the past 

I'm 30 now and need to cut this crap out, I drank my whole 20s away and that's not an exaggeration I was drinking a liter of vodka per day toward the end of it. I stumbled upon this sub a few weeks ago and it seems like it's a helpful community so I hope you guys welcome a new poster 😊",t3_o0haz0
305,Sooooo. Sober sex? lol,"Not even sure if this is an appropriate sub for this, but don't know where else to ask.

How long does it take to be good at sex again after entering sobriety? I have always suffered from extreme social anxiety, which basically means that unless in a long term relationship, pretty much 90% of my sex has been drunk. I just relapsed this weekend, but I'm going to start attending meetings this week after work. The problem is that I'm so used to having booze in me when I'm getting laid.. well.. things tend to go pretty quickly in the bedroom when I'm sober because I'm so much more sensitive. OR I get so nervous that I will finish early that it will actually prevent me from getting it up and all.

Is this a common thing for guys and, if so, how long does it take to go away?",t3_o0dj3u

307,2 months and a realisation today.,"Got to two months today. I am feeling more confident than on any of my other attempts, but I still find myself romanticising about drinking and today I realised something. 

Before I ever started drinking, I was at risk of becoming addicted to alcohol. Through personality type, upbringing, genetic make-up or whatever it was. When I look back I can say with 100% certainty that I had what it took to become an alcoholic. 

Therefore, it will never matter how long I abstain for, or how healthy I become, the best I can ever hope for, is to go from someone who is addicted to alcohol, to someone who is at risk at becoming addicted. I mean, even if I could magically change the course of history and make it so that young me never touched a drink, I'd still be at risk. I know this for a fact, because I did a 25 year drinking experiment and have the results. 

That truth caused a real shift in the perception of my addiction today and made it much easier to bat away thoughts of drinking. I thought I would share it in the chance that it might help someone else. 

When I set out on becoming sober I acknowledged that I didn't know how to be sober, and would need to learn how to do it as I go. Well, this is one of the things I've learned.",t3_o0h2e4
308,"""In Treatment"" Season 4 is a great portrait of a functional problem drinker","The TV show ""In Treatment"" Season 4 really illustrates the concept that you can have a great-paying job, be pulled together, smart, likable, competent, and be helping others and still have a major drinking problem. And it's not glamourous or fun. I greatly appreciate shows that show the nuance of drinking---they don't glamourize it and make it seem like everyone is doing it, but they also don't make the drinking characters stereotypes who are at rock bottom either. They show the character off the wagon/in relapse and her fallout in a realistic way. It's really great. 

Successful people living in gorgeous homes in Baldwin Hills can struggle with alcohol too. 

If you're someone who never reached rock bottom or was more on the ""functional"" side, you may appreciate the portrait that this show gives.",t3_o0idky
309,Just passed the five week point! IT CAN BE DONE.,"Last night was night 35 - aka the end of week 5 - since I quit drinking. I know that's a low number compared to a great many here, and not an ""out of the woods""-level period of sobriety by any means, but I'm amazed at myself. It had been years since I'd gone more than a few days, and months since I'd gone more than a day. In the five weeks before I finally admitted I had a problem, I didn't skip a day of heavy, heavy drinking.

I'm writing this mostly because I looked for posts like this when I first decided I was at a critical point five weeks ago, and I hope someone else at that same point can find this post in their lowest moment. I remember scrolling through r/stopdrinking back on May 10 and struggling to imagine making it even a couple days without a drink. Then struggling through my first weekend. Then making it through week two, then three, and so on. Some of my fear of quitting was anticipating the struggle, and it hasn't been easy, but it's been accomplishable.

Instead, I feel clear headed, physically refreshed, more present and happy with my family, calmer, less anxious, and most of all, proud.

If this is your first night, or you are hoping for your first sober night soon, please don't let the fear of the struggle keep you from trying. You can stop. I believe in you.

I will not drink with you tonight.",t3_o04594

311,Day 6!,Hi guys just felt like writing my experience so far. Had a rough vodka + wine bender this last time and I felt like I was throwing up gasoline. Hurt so bad and my body was just done. Took 2 days to feel normal again but the days after that have been amazing. I’m back to my workout schedule I’ve been so productive and my sleep is better and my head is starting to clear. When I think of alcohol I can almost feel the burning in my throat and stomach and could almost gag. So I’m kinda glad I went through that because I needed to. It’s actually given me kind of an aversion so it’s helping me not crave it. Anyways just wanted to check in with the community hope everyone’s doing better everyday.

312,Successful sober weekend.,"I just recently relapsed after 5 months of sobriety. This past weekend I went on a trip with my sister and some of her friends from high school. We rented a couple cabins and hung out at a lake with everyone’s kids.I was very nervous. I was with a group of people I know but am not close with. Drinking would have made everything so much less awkward. But I had wonderful experience that made me happy to be sober. 

Each night we all had to go inside and put our kids to sleep. The second night I was holding my two year old and rocking him to sleep. I could see the lake outside the window and heard the birds chirping, it was the most relaxing moment. If I had been drinking I would have been SO annoyed my son was taking away from my drinking time. But because I was sober I was able to enjoy each moment for what it was.

When I am drinking I obsess every moment about when my next drink will be. I am never truly in the moment. Sobriety has allowed me to truly enjoy the time I have with young kids. Iwndyt",t3_o05qbz

When I came home she was still in bed.

315,5th Day Sober - why did I do it for so long?,"That’s the one nagging question that I woke up with today. The morning headaches, the fear when you look at your phone, the shame of the bottles left out the night before looking back at you with disdain as you stumble around cleaning up.

My relationship with alcohol was like being with an abusive partner. It hurt me and never built me up but there was a familiarity in its brutality. There were times I greeted that hangover with a ‘hello old friend’ joviality.

It also seem to say things like;

‘You’re nothing without me’ 
‘You can’t be funny without me’
‘How are you going to relax without me?’

And the one I had the most difficult time with;

‘You’re not strong enough to live without me’

But I have, for 5 days now and I really don’t want to go back to it.

Reading all of your stories in this sub have really helped me over this period, realising that we aren’t alone in this and that fighting against the normalisation of such a booze-heavy culture (I’m in the UK) when struggling is not easy. So thank you all.",t3_o09e6e

317,Suicide - Check in on your friends today!,"My 120th day of sobriety was learning that my youngest cousin took her own life. Over the past 5 years she has shown obvious public displays of someone who is in severe mental decline. 

It appears that she had begun using meth and quickly lost most of her teeth. She had also lost custody of 1 or both of her children. She was married to a guy who was roughly 20 years older and was the noticeable part of her decline.

Her public posts mentioned many things about hearing voices and had a very elaborate story about people planting bugs in her head. I’m positive that this was a direct cause of using and staying up for days on end. 

The family had made several attempts to get her mental help with no success. 

She never made it to full on junky or rock bottom, from what I saw. Unfortunately the strain of life was more than she could bare and she hung herself. Leaving behind 3 children, her husband, her brother and mother &amp; father. 

It doesn’t always happen slow, it doesn’t always happen to the people you expect, it doesn’t care who you are... addiction and, more importantly, chemical dependence, allows your brain to rewire its ability to process rational thoughts. Everything in your mind is always right and everyone else is always wrong. I just can’t stop thinking that her last thoughts were “I shouldn’t have done this”. 

Call or text 1 friend you may even slightly be concerned about. It may not mean much to you, but it may just be enough to keep someone from taking their own life.",t3_o08yj8

321,Lying about my sobriety date,"Hello friends- I started my longest stretch of continuous sobriety on 9/28/20. I have told my spouse, my therapist, my therapy group, and a few others since recently beginning AA that I have been continuously sober since then. However, the reality is that I had 5 days in February that I drank, so my real date now is 2/26/21.

I justified lying by omission by saying that if I was honest and “reset” my days down to zero I might just say fuck it and really spiral out until whatever point I decided to actually start trying again. When I first started getting sober I didn’t even count days for this reason, until I realized I needed to for some accountability and goal setting. Really, it was just intense shame and fear of what people would think.

Tonight I went to a meeting where another woman mentioned in her share that she had had done the same thing and eventually came clean. I finally got some clarity that I need to do this now before I hit false milestones like one year. I texted her after the Zoom to thank her, and texted my sponsor that I need to chat with her tomorrow. Will tell my therapist during our session tomorrow, and talk to my husband when he gets home from work in the morning. I’ll talk to my group during our next session and I think that will cover anyone I’ve talked to about my sobriety date.

326,I left my pregnant wife alone in a hotel room on vacation while I went out drinking.,"And that’s not even the worst part. The worst part is that just happened a month ago, and I already drank again. 

I really did want that to be the last time, the final straw, the absolute end of letting alcohol wreak havoc on me and my marriage. I wanted the time before that to be the last time too... and the time before that. 

The only thing that has been consistent about my sobriety recently has been the relapses. I’m sober 8 months, drink for a weekend which ends in cataclysm, quit for 3 more months, rinse and repeat. 

I’m just tired of losing to alcohol. I feel like I win so often; nearly every time I get in the ring, but all it needs is just a sliver of an opening and bam I’m straight on my ass again, reeling from the pain and the new irreparable damage I was left to deal with this time. 

Well I’ve had enough. I’m going to take some more tangible steps to get right in my sobriety before our baby comes. God only knows I don’t want my daughter to ever know what a drunk her dad can be.

327,Am I an alcoholic? 1 year journey,"Long time lurker, but thought I would share some thoughts to celebrate a year of not drinking. For background, I grew up in the US and began drinking in high school on the weekends, then steadily increased frequency throughout college and my 20’s, peaking in my early 30’s with 5-7 nights a week of heavy beer drinking (6-12 beers a night, generally high ABV craft beers). Some things happened in my personal life that made me decide it was finally time to stop drinking, and I stopped in early June of 2020 and have not had a drink since then. 

The biggest thing that scared me about stopping drinking was the social stigma and the label of “alcoholic”, because from what I knew, alcoholic was a life sentence and there was no way to shake that label. And, alcoholics were one of two things: they were either on the street doing nothing but drinking all day and begging for money, or they were “in recovery” and never drinking again. I am fortunate enough to not fall into the first category, which meant the only way for me to become an alcoholic was to voluntary take on the title myself by quitting drinking, and there was no way I was gonna do that. This thinking led to the insane paradox where I would only be an alcoholic if I stopped drinking. But if I kept drinking, I was fine. So I kept drinking. 

When I decided to stop, I had no idea what that was going to mean long term, but I knew the first step was to physically stop drinking alcohol, which I did. I was not magically happy or content with my life all of a sudden. However, I was waking up without a hangover every day for the first time since I was a teenager, and that felt great (still does woohoo). A few weeks in, I started reading all kinds of alcohol related books/blogs/research papers, etc., aka “quit lit”. One of the most helpful articles I read was about this question of “am I an alcoholic?”. I learned that for me, answering this question was not actually helpful. I could genuinely, honestly answer yes or no and be telling the truth completely. 

No: I’ve quit drinking for a few weeks at a time before, and I have a successful career, a wife and kid, a great group of close friends and family, and I don’t drink nearly as much as that homeless guy on the corner. Of course I’m not an alcoholic. 

Yes: I drink every single day and often blackout, I hide my drinking from my wife, I do the bare minimum at my job because I am hungover every day. Of course I’m an alcoholic. 

The problem here is that regardless of my answer to the question, both outcomes are bad. No, not an alcoholic? Great, keep drinking and leading a miserable life full of lies and hangovers. Yes, I’m an alcoholic? Well shit, I’m doomed for life and everyone is going to think I’m a loser. (Note: This dichotomy may not be applicable for many folks who do in fact identify with the term alcoholic and find the term to be helpful and freeing. I support that 100% and am happy it works for that group. I’m simply describing my own experience in hopes that others who feel similarly might relate). 

For me, the much more useful question to answer was “is alcohol making my life better?”  The answer to this question was much less ambiguous. I could say unequivocally that, at this point in my life, alcohol was making my life worse. It may seem silly, but this simple mindset shift gave me a huge sense of relief because I could now stop drinking without caring whether I was an alcoholic or not. For me, it was/is much easier to avoid alcohol when I think about it as a positive lifestyle choice instead of something I “have to do” because of a “condition” I have. Again, this is speaking for me only and not intended to disparage any other ways people successfully abstain from drinking. 

Anyway, I have my good days and my bad days like anyone else, but I can say my life without drinking is, no question, better than it was a year ago. One phrase that has stuck with me is this: the only thing scarier than the thought of not drinking for the rest of my life, is the thought of drinking for the rest of my life.

331,Self grace,"Grace (in religious terms) is the love that a deity feels for its creations regardless of their merit. Even the worst, most sinful creatures receive god's grace in most religions. 

Addicts who have been in recovery for a long time have said that finding self love was so important in their journey, and that is something that I really struggle with. I struggled for the longest time because I didn't think I deserved to love myself. I didn't think that my actions merited self-love. 

Yet I found myself sympathizing and loving other alcoholics who made the exact same mistakes that I did. I wondered why I could have so much grace for others, but not for myself, even when we did the same bad things.

It is a wonderful feeling, after all, to go to a meeting or post here about my darkest failures and receive love. To feel like, in other's eyes, I am deserving of something good to happen in my life even if I'm fundamentally flawed in some way. 

Its no wonder that humans have for so long associated grace with deity. It's an emotional force of creation, whereas self-loathing and despair are emotions of destruction. 

So, my plan for now is to treat myself with more grace. I'm going to show myself love, compassion, forgiveness, and compassion, even if I feel that I don't deserve it. I need to be a constructive force in my own life instead of a destructive one.

332,Notes on 10 Days,"Well, today I reach double figures without drinking. Sadly, this is the longest I have managed for some considerable time. Like many others, I have been locked up for the last 18 months working from home, and until recently, unable to see friends or family. I have been a heavy drinker for many years, but the loss of freedom hit me hard, so I hit the bottle hard.
Finally, I woke up and realised the best way to fight this horrendous situation is with strength; to stand up and spit back in the face of the pandemic. 

I will NOT drink myself to death and become another indirect victim. 

After 10 days, I have been delighted to note the following positives:
* Reduced anxiety;
* Improved confidence at work;
* No longer bloated;
* Much healthier skin (my face is as smooth as a baby's bottom!);
* Improved fitness and energy levels; and 
* Better sleep.

337,Little story time while on vacation.,"Hey Guys. Lurker here. This is my first post and it turned into a long one! 

I joined this sub in January 2020 when I tried my first attempt at stopping drinking. I made it two months until a work trip where I caved to the social pressure and drank allllll the sangria. 

I kept drinking last year, knowing I had a bad relationship with alcohol, mostly wine and whiskey. I read Naked, as recommended by many here, and found myself nodding enthusiastically throughout. But I remembered how hard it for for me to stop for two months and I didn’t want to try again. 

Again, like many here, no one would consider me an Alcoholic. I am about a decade past my twenties where I had the regular wasted nights blacking out and waking up with serious regrets having to ask “what did I say last night??” (Although I did have a couple of those in the last couple years that rocked me with embarrassment so hard, I still cringe when I remember). But colleagues and friends just think “everyone has a night like that once in a while.” That might be true, but not everyone has to actively fight to not have nights like that. I knew my relationship with alcohol was unhealthy. I looked for the bar first anywhere I went. I loved work trips so I could expense rounds of drinks. I bought bottles of wine in bulk and started pouring glasses as soon as I stopped working. Drinking loosened me up and decreased my social anxieties. It helped ease my stress after a long day. 

Until it didn’t. I started to feel unfocused during the day and my depression and anxiety worsened. I knew drinking was wrecking my sleep so I was exhausted all the time. I felt sad and I figured I might as well try to stop again because alcohol isn’t helping me. So I did. I had my last drink on December 31st, started a dry January and haven’t stopped. I found this article to be helpful:
https://www.verywellmind.com/is-this-normal-how-long-will-it-last-80197. I constantly checked it to see if what I was feeling was “normal.” I got to my first milestone by surpassing my original track record of two months. By the time I got to three months, I felt more focused, my skin looked better and I was sleeping. So I kept going. 

I’m on vacation right now (following all Covid protocols - things are lifting where I am) and yesterday I woke up feeling SICK. I was nauseous and had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I had that ready to vomit feeling for a part of the morning until I chugged some water and ate. Dehydration is likely the culprit but I was reminded of why I’m not drinking. My husband continues to drink - and a lot more on a holiday - so if I’m honest, I started to tell myself, “maybe one glass of champagne to celebrate things getting back to normal.” “Maybe I should get some wine with dinner; I’ve proven I don’t NEED to drink.” Then I woke up feeling like I had a hangover and thought “OK COOL, thanks, Universe. This feeling sucks.” Back to the virgin mojitos. Almost like some universe kudos, I received my app notification later in the day saying “Congratulations.” I reached 165 days without a drink. 

It really is about mindset. When I tried to stop in 2020, I went on a vacation and was MISERABLE being the only sober one. All I thought about was booze and I felt so deprived. This time around, I am loving being able to just BE. Just able to be present and relaxed. I feel lucky, not deprived. Healthy, not broken. 

TLDR; Just wanted to post this to encourage others who might be thinking about stopping. You can do it and life is so much more after you do. Also, virgin mojitos are delicious.",t3_o0erla
338,Day 44 ... I am a bit overwhelmed maybe,"Day 44 for me. I had a bit of a crazy day. Woke up at 5:30, went very early for groceries, I think at 7:30... Then made the contract ready for the school and the application for the landlord. I have to wait for one more paper, hopefully it will arrive soon. It was a lot of paperwork...
Then did a 50 minute workout with my dancer friend (she's merciless). Then breakfast and tea. Then I drove across the city for a fitting for a movie (the last acting job I will do before I leave). Now on my way home for another online appointment. Then I have an acquaintance bring me some documents. And THEN I will be done for the day. 

I am tired. And hungry. I'm sad when I'm tired. I am thinking of my last failed romance and although I deleted all the chats and everything and I know this had to end... I am sad. Sad about leaving. Sad about everything. Sad about being single. I miss my friend. He doesn't miss me. I accept. I'm still sad about this.

I think the day was just really overwhelming. And I need to eat. Two boys with beer are sitting next to me in the train. I feel something maybe close to a craving. But it's more a craving for rest and a hug. For a warm cozy blanket. For someone to tell me that I'll be okay. That I got this.",t3_o0grki
339,"Day 17, always tired, depressed, sleeping way too long","So I drank about a bottle of wine and 2 beers a day.

I stopped because I was concerned about my health, and I thought I would feel better, yes even Euphoric! But here I am, tired, sluggish, sleeping 10-12(!!!) Hours a day and not having fun with anything.  I am just lazy now. 

Isn't this kind of paradoxical? Isn't alcohol supposed to make you feel depressed, lazy and make you oversleep? Not the other way around?

Is this normal or should I visit a doctor?  Does anyone had the same experiences like me the first month? Will it get better? Or did the Alcohol maybe ""treat"" another undiagnosed Illness I have? I don't think that I have or had Depression, I am generally a Happy Soul so I don't really get it.

340,Checking in to rehab today,"I've messed up my life pretty good this last year. I've slipped up and let down my son and my family over and over and over. I've potentially shot down my chance at graduating from med school with a doctorate - a mere 1 year away.

I don't have many people left to share this with. I've lurked on this subreddit a lot the past few weeks, and I've found solidarity with a great deal of the things I've read from so many of you champions.

I've never done inpatient this long, and I'm destroyed to be away from my son for so long (40 days), but I know this is what I need to do. The sneaking, the lying, the deceit.. It's exhausting, and it isn't who I really am inside. I don't recognize the person I've become and I don't want to be this person any longer. I won't do this anymore. I refuse to keep choosing this life.

In sobriety I am either completely blank in the emotional sense, or super eager to have a good time and listen to nice music.

Sadness still exists yet somehow I cannot feel it, should I be happy? Does not feel correct after getting of booze, I expected extreme depression. Instead I am not extremely happy nor extremely sad.",t3_o0okqe

Someone handed me another drink, but I said no, and poured it down the sink while debating about coming here and resetting my badge. I felt so shit and sad with myself. Then the dream morphed into a recurring one I've had for years, where I'm running about my old school but it has all these secret rooms and wings. So I guess that was kind of neat!

344,Today I have 2 years sober!,"I really do have a life beyond my wildest dreams today. I get to be a mother to my children, a daughter to my mother, and I get to walk other women through the steps that changed my life. Before I got sober I was hopeless, desperate, and broken. As an alcoholic who chased her vodka with meth, I never thought I could be a happy functioning member of society. Today I get to enjoy the peaceful moments, work through the tough ones without a drink, and go to sleep at night knowing I am doing the best I can. I love my life today. I am so grateful for this journey through sobriety, for all the others who came before me, and for all those who will come after me.

345,Day 2. Here i go again.,"Reason number 1000 to stop drinking. The anxiety it has caused me. I have become more nervous in public situations  due to drinking (like haircuts and eye doctor and the like). I'm hoping that subsides.

346,Energy and sobriety,"I can't believe how much more energy I have in just a short time. It was just shy of 2 months ago that I decided to only drink on special occasions. Then a life event on the 4th of this month switched that commitment to *never* drinking again at all. From drunk 4 days each week to 4 beers since the end of April (none since June 4) my energy has rebounded like I never knew it could! 
For years I've grown so used to feeling horrible that I forgot what it felt like to not be in a tunnel. I was asleep by 8:30 most nights and never slept well as I'd wake up at 2am from my brain sobering up. Then it was 30 minute naps until time to get up for work. 
Sound familiar?  Now I'm up until 11:00pm every day and almost forcing myself to bed so I can sleep like a baby. 

My point to this is there are 1,000 reasons not to drink. I can't pick them all so for today I choose not drink for just one reason; so I can feel good all day and stay awake through a good movie tonight.  Tomorrow I might pick another reason but for today that is my plan and I hope you pick a meaningful daily reason for yourself.",t3_o0fmqr
347,Day 1. Again. Harder now.,"This might be a bit ranty and random... my mind is a mess right now. I've been trying to wean down on my drinking and that part is going mostly well... gonna try to do today completely without alcohol because yesterday I didn't even get the shakes at all, though I did have a couple of drinks after work. Weed truly helps my anxiety more than booze, so I am allowing myself that. I considered getting the vivitrol shot, but then had to cancel my health insurance because my premium went from $70 up to $240 per month without any explanation being provided and i cant afford that at all. My partner and I just split up a week ago due to both of our drinking,  so I am putting all the money I have towards a new apartment. We are still friendly but both know we can't be romantically involved. I'm working extra to keep myself distracted from my own anxious thoughts, so the financial situation will improve... I work in a restaurant at a bar, so drinking regularly is essentially the culture. I have tomorrow off, which is good because I'll just be around my sober friend who I am staying with currently instead of near a bar. I'm just finding myself tired, unable to sleep, and stressed about everything so not drinking has been more difficult this time around than in the past when I've tried not to. In 2 days I will move into a place with 2 complete strangers, which makes me very very anxious because I've never had the best luck with roomies in the past. I was severely assaulted by my last random roommate over 10 years ago and left with permanent bodily damage that I'm still doing PT and chiropractic treatment for out of pocket... it just feels like everything is crumbling around me. I know quitting drinking won't just fix everything, but I also know it will help decrease my anxiety in the long run and be beneficial in many other ways. I don't know why I'm even writing this I guess... I just am anxious and need some support I guess. I very strongly dislike AA. Tried it before and have considered trying it again, but personally find forum groups to be less judgmental and more open minded in general. Plus then no one ever sees my face...  I'll never run into a person at the grocery store who knows my traumas or how fucked up my head is.  I have very bad social anxiety. I have horrible PTSD. It just feels like everything is coming all at once lately and it's been a lot to handle... but one day at a time, right? I kicked opiates... this should be easier, but it isn't really.  I feel like it's a very different sort of struggle. It isn't like I get sick without booze, just extremely anxious... here goes some effort though. I will not drink today.",t3_o0ak6i
348,For tomorrow me;,"I am writing this post for my tomorrow self. 

I feel awful. I feel fat, bloated, sick. I am anxious and convinced my husband is being shady, whereas before I drank i thought that he was being super sweet. In all honesty, maybe he is being shady.. because I know he's mad at me about drinking; he won't even look at me.

I am rethinking every life choice, replaying every bad moment in my life. I've had to shut down a hundred thoughts to text inappropriate people. Normally, blackout me wouldn't be able to shut that down and I would wake up to embarrassment. I guess that's a win for the evening.

I have thought about suicide more than once tonight. Yesterday, I was amazed at the possibilities in life, and today after drinking... I wanted to end it all. 

This is not a feel good drug, it does not make things better. Drinking will ruin my life... and although sometimes that's what I feel like I want, it's not. My body hates feeling this way, I hate feeling this way, the people in my life hate me this way. 

I am getting my motivation back. Everytime I want to drink again, I am re-reading this. 

Life has to be better than this.",t3_o066uv
349,Back for an honest attempt.,"My day count next to my name is what it would have been if I never reopened this goddamn pandora's box. I am on day 2. I'll reset it at some point. I don't know, what can I say. I made it two months without a single drop of booze. Then I started again. I was fine for a good long while, keeping it to 1-2 days per week, but those days were binges as usual. It's just how I drink. I wish I didn't enjoy turning my brain off. My life is not so bad, most people pray every day for the things I have. I have faced my past regrets and self-loathing. I have escaped one addiction already, but drinking has been harder to drop.

Anyway I'm tired of it once again. Tired of feeling like I'm living for the weekend drinking. Tired of being stagnant in my fitness and weight loss goals. I am trying to be kind to myself. I have done amazing things since quitting weed, made so many positive changes in my life, vastly improved my mental health, dropped 60 pounds! None of that is erased by my struggle with drinking. When I made it two months with no booze, I felt so damn good. I had this sense of inner peace like I was just living life in the moment and wasn't fighting with myself constantly about wanting to get high. I want to get that back, I want to feel that again.

Anyway the beginning is not so tough for me. I can get 2 weeks pretty easily, but once I start feeling really good, that's when the thoughts start sneaking in, ""1-2 days a week isn't bad, you don't have a real problem, just enjoy yourself, you only live once."" Yea damn right you only live once, and what if I could get even more out of life if I were 100% sober? Even after breaking free from one addiction, I somehow still consider inebriation to be fun, relaxing and pleasant. Does that feeling ever go away? I somehow doubt it.",t3_o0i961

Even at the end of the night they poured shots for the staff after closing and I gave mine to my friend. :)

353,Another day 0,"Honestly, I’m struggling. I was doing pretty well for a few months. Managed to cut back on alcohol, and my drinking habit felt more like a “normal” person’s - a few drinks on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I was so proud, and felt like I was finally in control.
Fast forward to mid-May, and I’m back to my old habits. First drink starting at 2:00pm, and until I go to bed. My depression and anxiety spike every few days, and I know alcohol is a major contributor. I’ve been prescribed antidepressants for my anxiety, and I know I shouldn’t be drinking while on them, but I can’t stop myself. Where did my sense of control go. I feel like a failure. I’m so exhausted, and sick of the way I feel physically and mentally. I need to stop.
My roommates are alcoholics, which makes everything so much more difficult to avoid. Moving isn’t an option right now. 
I feel like I’m rambling, but I needed to get my thoughts down. This subreddit has always been so incredible to read through, and I love this community. This is my first post actually!

356,Forced sobriety in a compulsory quarantine hotel,"Recently arrived in mainland China and quarantine is taken very seriously. People in full PPE escorted us the entire bus trip to the quarantine hotel, where guests have to stay for 3 weeks. Temperature checks twice a day like clockwork, and so far I've been swabbed for testing every other day.

I ordered groceries that included liquor on my first day, and my order was screened and the liquor was taken out. Turns out they don't want drunk people doing stupid things and apparently body temperature can fluctuate quite a bit among the drunk-hangover-sober phases.

I'm not physically dependent on alcohol, but I had been drinking almost daily and I am extremely surprised at just how much I crave it. I actually contemplated calling a friend so he can sneak some booze to me in a hanging basket through my 5th floor window, but I eventually resisted. 

I still have 2 more weeks of quarantine left to go and hopefully I will be able to extend my sobriety.",t3_o03kyl

359,I Almost Lost My Focus,"Well I was trying to wait for the Check-In to post this on there, but I should have been in bed 2 hours ago (I can't sleep) so I'm just going to make this separate post where I can make it longer anyway, and then going to bed.

As many of you know I started my attempt at quitting smoking on Wednesday. I was very confident in my sobriety and was in a great mental state and ready to take on the next big one! But I did promise here and to some people ""IRL"" that I would be kind to myself, not be too hard on myself, and not push myself if I felt like it was compromising my sobriety. I didn't feel like I needed to worry about that too much, but I made a plan for it anyway.

First 2 days went great. 0 smokes, great attitude. Went back to work Friday, only had one smoke at the end of the day before bed because my mental state was starting to slip a bit. A bit depressed, an intrusive thought here or there. Of course I was prepared for that kind of thing so I had my smoke and moved on, didn't beat myself up about it.

Saturday I had 2 smokes, started feeling really down and kind of lost, but still handling it.

Sunday we were visiting my mom and we always smoke a lot there. I had like 5 smokes left in the pack I bought Tuesday so I decided I'd just smoke them all throughout the day and not buy another pack. I thought not having it around would help. Got a huge migraine that night. Still being kind to myself but feeling overall down.

Monday I had 2, just bummed from people. Intrusive thoughts were getting worse and I was pretty depressed but still pushing.

Today I had a few and my mental health took quite the dive. And it happened. I started getting cravings for alcohol again. I even started trying to make excuses to myself again, which I haven't done the whole 65 days. 

""If you're telling yourself it's still a success to have 3 cigarettes instead of a whole pack in a day then you can have 3 shots and not a whole bottle and that's still a success too, right?""

""You went 2 whole days without a cigarette and you were really proud of yourself. It's been 2 MONTHS since you had a drink. You can have one. That would still be great. Look what you've done, it's so great. Just one night then you can stop again. You deserve it.""

""You have the car today, go to the liquor store on your way home. No one will judge you.""

My mind was stretching for it's re-entry into the Olympic mental gymnastics team.

I did a whole ""LALA LALA I'm not listening!"" And wouldn't even let myself finish the thoughts (I later played them through to see what they were going to be when I felt more calm and comfortable), and I still did not WANT to drink, but I knew I'd have to postpone this no smoking journey.

During this whole thing I have been neglecting to be active in my recovery. I haven't had the energy, I've been exhausted and depressed and spending what energy I had wrestling with a different demon and it shows. I haven't been reading my quit lit book, I haven't been on here barely at all, I haven't been writing. I got too vulnerable trying to deal with the one new thing that the journey to better myself as a whole  became weaker and my little self-sabotage voice tried to swoop in a destroy everything I've done so far. But I didn't let it.

So, I'm not ready. I'll try again at 90 days like I originally planned, maybe even 120 if I have to, but for now I'm still a smoker. I'm okay with that and I'm glad I made a plan and didn't let my confidence stop me from being realistic. I am still no longer a drinker, and IWNDWYT.

360,Book &amp; Movie Tuesday,"Happy Tuesday! Can't wait to discuss books, movies, podcasts, and music with y'all as usual!

I'm machete-ing my way through the dense textual forest that is *Absalom, Absalom!* still and while I wouldn't say I'm enjoying it, it does seem about time that I read some challenging lit again and I will feel good about the accomplishment when it's over. 

What I'm really enjoying is *Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory* by Raphael Bob-Waksberg who was one of the creators and showrunners of one of my favorite shows, *Bojack Horseman*. Huge thanks to u/thesobersmidgen for recommending it a few weeks ago. Thursday night, I believe it was, I went to bed and as the stories in it so far had been quite short, pulled up one to relax with for a few minutes before sleeping. Not the greatest idea because it did not relax me, haha. Started as a typical short story about a couple planning their wedding and then what he did with the plot was so bizarre and unexpected that it just tickled me. Like I was laughing uncontrollably and crying and gasping for air uncomfortably as if someone was holding me down tickling me. Haven't experienced that from anything in a while, especially a book! It was a while before I got to sleep. Who says sobriety isn't wild? I was up past 10 o'clock that night! And it was a weeknight! 

I've been doing a ton of reading actually since I'm again unemployed. I read *The Plot* by Jean Hanff Korelitz this past week and enjoyed that too. And am reading *Early Morning Riser* by Katherine Heiny and am liking this one as well. 

Not much sobriety content from me this week. There's not much drinking in any of these books (so far at least). Which is great with me but gives me nothing to rant about here, lol.

368,"Hello Rock-Bottom, My Old Friend. I have come to rems with you again.","Today I hit my all time low by using my 10 minute break to buy a pregnancy test, case of hard seltzer, a single serving of shitty vodka and a 16oz. Diet Pepsi ( that I promptly emptied the tiny vodka bottle into) at the market across the street. 

I suspected I may have miscalculated/forgotten my ovulation date, due to being chronically buzzed/drunk for the last 2.5 months. I then proceeded to barricade myself in our restaurants only bathroom for 5 minutes while I took the test.

I’m 34 as of April and have been struggling to stop for 7-8 years now. My longest stretch being November 2019-May’ish 2020. I still recall what disrupted everything. My sister graduated college and we could only virtually celebrate. I was handed a glass of Prosecco. Game over.

Today, I was low key working my way through a Koia Shake that I added a single serving shot of vodka to (gotta mask the alcohol while at work, right?). I didn’t cry or have a meltdown. I didn’t even feel that bad. I just felt numb but aware of how far away I’ve gotten from who I want to be. My life story has evolved into the makings of a bad sitcom.

The test was negative, but it dawned on me that this is my reality right now. I’m the girl who blacks out from binge drinking every 4 or so days. Can’t remember if protection was used or if somehow cum made its way inside of me.

I wake up 2 weeks later to my boobs being swollen and then have to take a pregnancy test at work to ease my nerves. This is not my ideal life……not even close. Hello Rock-bottom, my old friend. 

PS: I just received my mail order of 50mg Naltrexone. I humbly and emphatically admit I can not get sober on willpower alone…..Let alone by myself. I’m open to remote meetings, intervention and/or gatherings. If you know of any, please feel free to DM me. Anyhoo…..

Thanks for listening. I can’t live like this anymore. (Not suicidal by any means, I do appreciate the gift of life and a new day. I’m just weak when it comes to telling myself no. Willpower is a mother fucker. I’m just over it 1000x over). In fact I live in a big beautiful home situated amongst a Redwood Tree grove. My commute is 12 minutes. I’m surrounded by optimistic, healthy normal people. My rent is beyond reasonable. My animals are the best. I have an amazing, generous, patient and sober man in my life…..I can afford to go to Uni. I know I’m fortunate…..I just fucking resent myself for not being able to give up alcohol. Please advise.

Last night provided me a good reason for doing so. I had a really vivid drinking dream last night. In my dream, I can’t really remember the circumstances but I recall that I drank two big cans of horrible cheap lager.

I remember having that “fuck it” feeling in my dream, and drinking the cans even though I knew I shouldn’t. I think I felt drunk and recall feeling the ‘oh yeah, that’s the stuff’ relaxed buzz mixed with a little bit of guilt and rationalisation by saying something like well I’m just having two and then I’ll go back to not drinking. In my dream I think I then ‘fell asleep’ and woke up feeling sick, hungover and supremely guilty for caving in and ruining my count on two lousy, nasty beers. 

When I woke up (for real) I briefly felt wretched and horribly guilty, followed by extreme relief that it was all a dream. It was like those dreams where you have cheated on your partner or something, it’s hard to explain.

It seems like a few people on here have had this type of dream. Can anyone tell me what this means and if I should be worried? Do I need to up my “not drinking” game, or is this a normal part of the process?

Thanks and IWNDWYT!",t3_o0cako
372,Can anyone share some rock bottom stories?,"I hit my personal rock bottom. Saddest thing is that I can’t stop drinking because even though it ruined everything, it’s all I can think of to make me feel better. I am seeing a doctor and tapering, so I’m working on it. But I just feel so alone and lost. I have lost everything I love and an amazing life I could never truly appreciate because my mental illness and alcoholism ruined everything.",t3_o09q1f
373,rehab on disability?,"i would check in to rehab tomorrow if it didnt mean possibly losing necessary medication (for adhd and ptsd, diagnosed). F24 on disability, was ripped off my anxiety meds at 19 bc i became disabled and insurance chaged to medicaid. I have gotten really intense with my alcohol self medication  the past year. on many therapy wait lists.  I am also physically disabled. 
 If i seek help with  detox/rehab, will i lose every opportunity of getting my ptsd meds back? will i lose my adhd meds? i dont want addiction rewriting all of my struggles, but i really want help.  I can take accountability, I'm an alcoholic, but i cant stop and Im not sure where to get help.",t3_o09ozh

375,Barely checking in,"I drank more than I think I ever have within 24 hours yesterday. So I woke up drunk and I’ve been sipping some seltzer’s to keep the shakes away.Feeling pretty clear but just want to be honest. (Im definitely not drunk but delete if necessary)

Also got mad at a mod for removing my post yesterday when they were CLEARLY in the right to remove it. Sorry to that mod, and thanks for not banning me :/

I’m basically choosing between alcohol and my BF. I want to marry him. He wants to marry me too, if I dont ruin our lives. I’ve been saying i’ll get better for weeks. Haven’t done it.

You don’t have to believe me. I barely believe myself. Just posting to try. I gotta still try, right? Yeah. It’s either suicide or keep trying. I’m gonna keep trying. I don’t really believe in myself atm but fuck it. Let’s try. Right?",t3_nzy4le
376,Damage of alcohol on dental health,"We are not talking this too much in this sub but I think it’s a very important additional reason for quitting drinking. Alcohol is straight away damaging the teeth and, it may cause teeth grinding at night, which can cause your teeth to hurt and be extremely sensible on the next day. Currently I am going through this second issue and let me tell you, you wouldn’t want to be on my shoes currently. Good luck to everyone out there!",t3_nzwe0m

379,My buddies made me a huge AA chip,Today two of my buddies stopped me and said in honor of my not drinking for 10 months they made me something. It's a big AA chip. Nice cherry stain. About 6 inches around and an inch thick. Can't share pics on here but I made it my Reddit profile Pic. Maybe you can see it if you click my name. I've never gone to AA so I don't have any real chips but this thing feels pretty special to me.,t3_nzvfdf

381,Driving.,"It's evening and you're out of milk.  So you get it.

It's after work and you have a craving.  So you get it.

Your car is low on gas.  So you get it.

There's a random social call.  So you go.

All simple things that aren't so simple when you have a Problem.  When did I last drink?  Am I sober enough?  Do I have the energy for this?  Gosh, I might get another bottle if I get in my car.  Well, if I wait three hours, I should be sober enough.  Oh, I'll go tomorrow.

It's annoying, isn't it?  Being physically and emotionally compromised as a semi-permanent status effect.

It is just so awesome for me to notice ""oh, I'm almost out of milk"" and I just go get it, and return, without a second thought.  No stress, no second thoughts.

I just finished working five days straight.  Past four days, I had either a Jones or Stewarts when I got home.  Both dehydration and a sugar craving.  REALLY hits the spot.  Got home today and noticed I was out.  So, just like that, I went out and got some Jones.  No dragging my feet, just went.  It wasn't until I got home that I realized that, yet again, it did not even occur to me to get vodka.

Oh, I do get cravings now and then.  But noticing that I'm not even thinking about vodka is nice.

382,Heading Out to Rehab,"Well all, I’m sitting at an airport cafe finishing up a bagel sandwich and sipping an iced coffee, one week sober and heading to treatment with a clear mind. I’m going in this with an open mind and open heart. I didn’t get signed up by anyone else or get dragged to the airport kicking and screaming…I just know that I need this. 

This is the first step I’m actually going all the way through with to kick this addiction I have. I want a better life. I want it not just for those around me, but for me. I deserve it. We all deserve it. 

Wish me luck, and I’ll talk to you all on the other side. ✌🏻",t3_nzocuu
383,Day 15 - doom projections.,"Hey people!

Ignore the badge - for some reason, I can't reset it, despite me mailing the badge change bot...

I suffer from incredibly bad doom projection. It was still there, but greatly diminished when drinking, and, now that I'm not numbing it out... well... it is almost unbearable... I think half the reason I drank so much was because alcohol and drugs were the ONLY thing that silenced this voice. 

My mind will find all sorts of reasons and things to ruminate about and turn around again and again and again... 

Why has this person not texted me back? DOOM PROJECTION. 

What am I doing next in life? DOOM PROJECTION

Why has my girlfriend not answered me? DOOM PROJECTION

What have I done wrong? DOOM PROJECTION

Why is that person behaving 'off' with me? It's my fault. DOOM PROJECTION

It is an almost-constant cycle of doom projection, panicking and attempts to self-soothe that go down the shitter, because the only way I know how to self-soothe is by getting blasted. 

My question is as follows: What do you guys do to stop the doom projection rumination in your minds? How do you control it? Does it go away? 

Background info... I come from a semi-abusive family where I was ignored, gaslighted, blamed for shit and interrogated over supposed wrongdoings from a very early age, and I have always felt a need to over-explain and justify things. When people treat me coldly, I revert back to being that abandoned, terrified child and fall over myself in order to 'make it up' to the person behaving coldly, and this pattern has been prevalent throughout my whole life, starting with my parents, continuing with other children at school, and it still exists to this day, especially with my partner.

385,Sore and tired and sober!,"I posted last week that I had an interview but I didn't think I got the job. It was at my previous place of employment, and my attendance was shit, all because of my drinking. Well, I got the job! Today was my first day back, and I'm soooo sore and tired, but it was a good day. Turns out it's much easier to do my job when I'm not hungover everyday. Who'da thunk? 

Wishing everyone well! IWNDWYT!",t3_nzzcwi
386,What do you all drink now?,"So, I have been sober for over 6 months now, but I feel like my teeth are starting to pay the price from all the other beverages I’ve been drinking. I drink water but find I’m often mixing that up with lemonade or juice or soda. Water all the time is just so boring!

This was all fine and dandy in the beginning when sobriety was the main goal and I needed to cut myself some slack, but now I’m wondering what else to drink that might be better for my teeth. I actually don’t want to lose weight, so calories are fine. I would just love to cut down on the sugar.

So let’s have it! What are your favorite no-alcohol and low or no sugar drinks?",t3_o05irh
387,I dont have a reason to stop…,"I want to stop drinking because my liver enzymes have been elevated for years, my drinking makes me emotionally unstable, it’s made me gain weight, I literally feel pains in my body that are clearly from drinking, but… I dont have a reason to stop. I’ve been depressed all my life and don’t really see a reason to continue living. I don’t have a dream of a better life. I hate my family. I have a few good friends but as we’ve all grown older, we’ve all grown somewhat apart. I’ve realized the truth is it’s all bullshit and then you die, so I guess I’ve been trying to expedite the process.

What do you do when you don’t have a reason? I can stop for a day or 2 or 7, but I always come back to drinking because it’s my only way to deal with the fact that life is completely meaningless. It’s all a joke.

Sometimes I wish I had the guts to just kill myself and get it over with. But here I am, asking if anyone has felt this way and what they felt might have helped.",t3_o05d2j
388,"Sober, sad and lonely","I’m at almost 14 months, and I usually try to be positive in my posts, but I’ve been feeling crummy lately. This week hit me like a ton of bricks for some reason.

I’m 26, married, have a job with its ups and downs. On the surface things aren’t too bad. But I’m on probation for a second dui I got last year and I just feel lost and lonely. Luckily there were never any accidents, but I’m definitely aware of how selfish those actions were.

Stopping drinking has brought me a lot of positives like eating and sleeping better, being less anxious all the time, and being much more focused with my job - just to name a few of many things. But despite all these, I feel very lonely as I’ve had to cut out my less-healthy friendships, and have had trouble meeting new friends that I have the same compatibility with. 

I like AA in many ways, but I also don’t always feel the most comfortable at the meetings. Being on the younger side I feel like I don’t fit in, and this always fills me with dangerous thoughts like “I can’t be an alcoholic when binge drinking is so common in my age group”. I know that’s not true but it’s scary how the mind can justify those thoughts. Monkey on my back I guess.

I also get really depressed thinking about how much potential I’ve thrown away because of my drinking. I can never be as confident as I was before because of all the embarrassing mistakes I’ve made. I think of my criminal record all the time and get really depressed about how it could effect world travel for me, which has been my dream for the longest time.

389,Secret drinker just realizing I have a problem.,"Last week, I could for the first time say that I am an alcoholic and finally believe it.  What’s worse is that I am a secret alcoholic. I buy vodka and drink it while I’m “just drinking beer.” My wife recognizes that I’m drunk and contributes it to the beer, but that won’t last..I need to stop. I hate the feeling the next day, and really being drunk doesn’t do anything for me anymore. I want to be honest with my partner, I want to be fit again, I want to not be tired anymore. I need to do this.",t3_o02qzt
390,"After 2 ER visits in a week, years of trying, I finally hit day 9","Today marks the longest I have ever been sober since I was 20 years old. I started drinking at 14, once a week, just some beers, no big deal right. 

Years go by and go off to college, this ramped up more to multiple times a week binging, 8-9 drinks would be an easy night (Thirsty Thursdays, F'd up fridays, marathon mondays) no big deal its college, everyone does this right?

Graduate college, go off and get my first real job half way across the country, no friends close by, family, I was the youngest in my department by about 10 years and the only native english speaker, so it was a tough transition. Love the guys I work with but its hard to ask a guy in his 30's with a family if he wants to grab a drink or shoot hoops after work haha. Attempted to meet people on meetup or through volunteering but its sort of awkward making friends for myself without alcohol.

Thats where it started. Drinking alone, 6 pack a night turned into 8, to 10, to eventually a 750 of bourbon every two days, sometimes only 1 a day. I always justified myself because I was high functioning, did well in school, at work, so who cares what I do in my free time?

My first ER visit during my self detox I had to go because I couldnt even keep water down, constantly vomiting, and eventually vomiting blood, severly dehydrated, the ER doc said in a very professional way of course, (your dumb for thinking you can do this alone, your primary should have helped you (oh trust me I asked him but thats a whole other story, but in his defense he never dealt with addiction) blood work came back and my liver was on the point of scarring, thank everything I stopped when I did. Unfortunately the wait was 8 hours and detoxing in an ER waiting room with 50 other people was unbearable, and the nausea and other medication the triage nurse/doc gave me made me feel a little better so I left.

Two days later, back to the ER, sorry for the details but lets say the other side of me was putting out blood 7 times in one day, possible internal bleed said triage, waiting the full 8 hours this time to get it over with. To say the ER doctor was a savior would be an understatement, treated me, gave me all the meds I needed and day 9, after almost 14 years of alcohol abuse I am starting to feel like myself again.

I went years shaving in the shower because I was ashamed to look myself in the mirror, I avoided public places, became a hermit basically.

The first 5 days were absolute hell dont get me wrong but the payoff I promise you is worth it

If anyone is afraid of the detox and are wondering what to expect, or what steps you need to start if your ready to quit, please feel free to reach out. Use this sub, it is really good therapy to read your not alone.

Im never going back, im 28 years old, ive drank most of my youth away, I truly hope that if even one person can take something from this the day will shine a little brighter for both of us.

Good luck to you all, one minute, one hour, whatever it takes to start but for now

391,Dinner with the Family; booze free,"I thought it was going to be tough, but it was great. My wife wanted to go to a patio now that things are finally open here in Toronto. I was a tad reluctant, but I felt it was important for me to not change everything around me, but to focus on myself. 

I was in the moment and enjoyed a beautiful dinner with my family and was present with them the whole time. I had a virgin Caesar and a non-alcoholic beer. I only drank half the beer and ended up drinking water instead. The Heineken 0% tasted weird. Anyone got any recommendations? I like the taste of beer.

My ex on the other hand, not so much. We aren’t together but we are still close and he is my child’s father. I made a post not too long ago in this sub about a DUI he recently got. This is almost a daily occurrence for him and he is a ticking time bomb. I’m so terrified of something bad happening to him and I just can’t relax. He was on the phone slurring his words with me driving around right now, I don’t even know what city he is in. I’m worried, his family is worried, this is just causing so much grief and pain for everybody. I know there is nothing I can do right now besides pray that everything will be okay, but I can’t stop freaking out. I just want to relax but I can’t.

395,Angry - !,"I find myself being angry.  We are towards the end or youth softball season so I am spending sometimes 8-10 hours outside in the heat at tournaments on the weekends.  The urge for a cold beer is almost overwhelming, but I will not drink one.  This really makes me angry for no good reason and I am mad and frustrated that I can't have a beer after a long day in the sun.  I do have a NA beer, but it is not the same.

Like many people here, I could not just have ""one"" and I would end up...ahem...taking a nap when we got home.

Anyway, IWNDWYT, but I may pout about it a little bit. :-)

Three more tournaments to go!  What are some of your go to drinks at a ballpark? Or during other outdoor activities?",t3_o0fnqx
396,Drunk people are annoying now,"This weekend I interacted with two drunk people via phone call and text and it was annoying. A girl friend from an old job called me randomly at 9:30 PM (late for me and we rarely talk!). It was cute at first because she said she was just calling people up to chat. But it was clear that once we got on the phone, she was very drunk.

It's frustrating because the whole time we talked, all I could think about was how she wouldn't remember the conversation in the morning.

The second situation I had previously posted about--texting an ex while he was drunk and him getting all open and honest. Because.....\*drumroll\* ALCOHOL!

Now that I'm not drinking, these interactions feel hollow on a lot of levels. I feel like the drunk versions of people are just who they wish they were sober.

I'm finally realizing after 24 days, I can be the person I want to be all the time. Without alcohol. I'm seeing it's easier to let go of your inhibitions without a substance, which feels like a good thing.

398,150 days Sober TODAY. 24 total lbs lost,"I’ve not been sober for this long in over 5 years. I feel incredible and due to my weight loss, my confidence is through the roof. Here are a few things I’m feeling great about now that I’m sober:

☞︎ I have energy to care about my appearance, so I look better.

☞︎ I have energy and space in my brain to care about the things I love.

☞︎ Motivation is back to have and enjoy hobbies.

☞︎ I feel like there is just more space in my mind to appreciate and enjoy life. 

☞︎ No more shaking hands from alcohol withdrawal 

☞︎ So many more good days but even my bad days are *still* better than the hung over alcohol withdrawal days of my past. 

☞︎ I LOST 24lbs YOOOO! with little to no exercise- granted now that I have more energy my daily activity is higher. And without being hungover I’m not craving garbage food like greasy cheeseburgers all the time. Self control is also easier w/o alcohol withdrawal. 

I still am noticing improvements even after 150 days. The me before I started drinking every day is very slowly coming back up to the surface. 

I have this sub to thank - I found you guys over two years ago and nothing has motivated me more to quit than coming here and seeing all the success stories (and struggles) thank you all so so much.",t3_nzrlsv

I only had a few seltzers each day. Didn’t get even close to drunk. Haven’t had anything even close to feeling it the next day. 

But I feel terrible. I’ve been such a good support to everyone here. I literally thought I’d never drink again because it just didn’t do anything for me anymore. 

But I let myself down and the community that gave me 5 1/2 months of health and clear thinking. 

I never had any rock bottom moments, but just knew alcohol was becoming more a part of my life than I was comfortable with. My wife actually didn’t like that I wasn’t drinking because she likes to have a few socially. That was the hardest battle. 

I’m sad that I gave in, but know the last half year has given me new perspective. And that means a lot. 

I owe so much to this group.",t3_o05d4h
403,Day 3 - Still Nervous and Tingly Feet,"So it's Day 3.  It's been about 63 hours since I had my last beer.  My feet are still a bit tingly and slightly numb near the toes, so I have scheduled a doctor appointment for the first available time.  I am going to try to be brutally honest.  I've spent way too much time on Dr. Google and I am scared shitless about what I may have done to my body.

I plan on continuing trying to eat some healthy food (though my appetite is not back at all, probably partly because of all the anxiety) and taking my Thorne Multivitamin (which has all of the recommended nutrients for controlling/reversing neuropathy).  

I hope I am not too late to do something about this.  My last bout of drinking began around March 15 and it slowly ramped up from about 1-3 beers/day to more like 8-12 beers/day and even more when I was traveling or on the weekend.  And I mean like 6-7% IPAs... So I'm hoping that the approximate 2 months of HEAVY drinking is not enough to cause permanent damage.  I also realize that some of my symptoms could just be nutritional deficiencies because I was barely eating, or maybe even some pre-diabetic symptoms since all of my calories were beer carbs and alcohol.  

The worst part is, I was doing so well.  My life was going so soooo great and I decided to ""celebrate"" in a way in March by allowing myself to drink.  What a terrible way to celebrate.  You know how I should have celebrated?  I should have bought myself something nice.  Or better yet, bought my wife and kids something nice.  I shouldn't have done something so selfish that took me away from them.  Alcohol makes me want to spend time shut up in my office by myself watching dumb shit.  Turns me into a boring slob.

Any kind of support would be huge right now.  My doctor appointment is not until Thursday (earliest I could get), but from what I've found even if they do discover something all they would do anyway is ask me to change my diet, stop drinking, and try to get my vitamin and mineral levels healthy so I'm trying to get ahead of all that.  

On a good note, the feeling of constantly having to urinate seems to have improved.  So maybe that's a good indication that things could potentially get better.

I have tried and tried to stop drinking for years but after a particularly bad night I just go a few weeks and the issue seems to dissolve and I do it again. I don't think I've had a sober weekend in 2 years....I'm a weekend binge drinker and I blackout most times I drink. The pain and embarrassment I feel the following several days is awful. I finally told my mom that I feel like I can't stop and she told me that I never have to do that to myself again and that helped me. She said that she always thought it would be my brother who had a drinking or drug problem. I just keep doing it to myself. I've missed so many Sunday family lunches due to my being so hungover that I can't function. I won't even get started on the fucked up shit I've done and said while being blackout. I even started using cocaine so that I can stay awake and party. This is of course in secret while no one else is doing it. I am a totally different person when I'm drunk. I'm a binge drinker, my friends are binge drinkers, my fiance is a binge drinker, his friends are binge drinkers, his family are binge drinkers. How do I do this while everyone around me does the same things? I'm just trying to stay home and focus on myself for now, try to spend more time with my mom because she doesn't drink at all. I'm so scared that I will start feeling good again and then find myself back in blackout city, having to apologize for what I did, wondering if I shared personal information, wondering if I cheated.

How do I stay on this path and not let myself forget just how bad things are? It's easy right now because the pain is still fresh but what about in 3 weeks? What if I forget?",t3_o04b9y
408,Day 4,"First post.  On day 4.  Was drinking probably 375ml vodka every night.  Sometimes more, rarely less for a few years.

Tingling has escalated since quitting but assume i am healing and if not I will survive.  GERD slightly better so that's encouraging.  

Anxiety was very bad day 2.  Now is periodic. But i am naturally anxious and have learned to cope somewhat.  Including by drinking way too much! 😬😬

Idk how that will work with my job and all, but work is not life (I'm quite literally being burnt out by this job, don't like it, never did i think but I've been a problem drinker since I started it 6 years ago) shit never ends but I've made is 1000% worse by my habits. Need a change now and that starts by not drinking and getting by and not worry about stressing too much during the day. In the early years of the job I could actually get away with doing very little. Now things have picked up steam and I can't seem to deal. Anyway enough rant.

 If anyone has any tips or stories about making big changes in your life after stopping please fell free to post.

I want to be someone happy a year from now in a better overall position at 30. But I know to do that I need to start now. Basically my old life has just slowly disappeared and everyone moves on with their things but I've just didn't do anything in my personal life except drink. I've lost so much time but hey better late than never I guess.

Thanks for reading and being here. I think I've talked to more people on here the last few months than I did in the last 2 years outside of family.",t3_o02bhi
411,Day 2 - alcohol almost ruined my life UPDATE,"Hi all. My very first post here was last week when I was rambling about my 1st real attempt at quitting during day 2. It was hell the first 4 days, but has gotten progressively better each day.. I am clearer and more present in my marriage and with my kids.

I am happy to say I have a full 7 days under my belt, soon to be 8. The weekend was difficult. I had to abstain from a family party to avoid temptation and stayed home with my youngest daughter, but I beat my cravings back by playing with her and doing household projects during nap time. 

I had my 1st full day of intensive partial hospitalization program rehab today. It went well. Very eye opening and reflective. I'm sure some participants don't find it valuable, but I did. The structure and content of my group therapy was huge. Many people dealing with various substance abuse issues and mental health problems. Granted it was only the first day, but I kept a positive attitude and participated as much as possible. I was very skeptical of these types of programs, but I have an upbeat outlook after today. 

Well, I just wanted to give an update. I'm hanging tough. This sub has been a life saver for me during these early days of sobriety. I am grateful for you all. Please continue your fights to sobriety. IWNDWYT.",t3_nzza00

413,Weight loss after drinking,"Not sure if this will get deleted or not, never posted here before. Just quit drinking and wondering if anyone lost any significant weight after they quit boozing, or if I shouldn't expect anything major.",t3_o04gdq
414,Tried and failed so many times... FINALLY understand what my brain and body do with alcohol and I'll never drink again.,"I'm copying and pasting this from a post I made in a psychedelic/spiritual group. Let me say first that psychedelics and spirituality are the reason I began my journey towards an alcohol free life. Not for everyone, but EVERYONE on the journey should benefit from mine.



Hey yall, need to vent. This will be long, sorry. Been a member and a fan for awhile, always hypothetically loved the idea of going to the gathering, but knew I could never afford it. Recently, I've made some huge life changes, including seeing a doctor for mental health and quitting alcohol. I'm a bartender- it's been hard. Had to distance myself from my friends, find a completely new identity, and think about what I TRULY want in my life; drinking has not only been fun, a fix-all, and my source of income, it was the dulling of the root of my issues- self hate.

Anyway, I'm winning. I'm about 3 weeks sober after years of a unique drinking problem. Through research and life experience, came to find that there is a specific type of brain that exists in humans, and it has the same issues for every person. According to some awesome studies (I can link if interested), we found that there is a fault, an imperfection, that passes down from certain fathers to their sons (much more prevalent in males for some reason, but that's their research). Some of us, myself and certainly my father included, convert alcohol to beta-endorphins, contrary to the rest of humanity. Beta-endorphins are what is made and released in your body when you do heroin. Not a surprise I had my issue with opioids years ago, got clean, but fell into alcohol. Your brain is smarter than you. When I drink, my brain makes a similar chemical to dope, but this chemical reaction is not only legal and accepted and accessible, its celebrated. This condition also cause the effects of alcohol to be stimulating and not dissociative, making it feasible and easy to become an all-day drinker. After coming to terms with my depression and alcohol addiction, I've decided to stop drinking, and tbh I'm on an antidepressant that I cannot drink on for threat of seizures, which I'm prone to. The reason I'm sharing this is because this is important to know if you or someone you love is going through it.
The other reason is- I'm saving money, getting healthy, and loving my transition into a brand new life, and it is an immediate goal to join the next gathering. Count on me to be there. I want to meet all of you and I've never been west of the eastern shoreline. Infinite love to you all.",t3_o03er6

416,Few More Hours,"Few more hours until I can make it through day one.  Blood pressure was erratic this morning and throughout the day.  Exhausted, few anxiety attacks but I'm going to get this done.  Not excited to try and sleep tonight but I hope it's better than I expect. 

It's been a long 3 weeks trying to get this under control.  I had to slowly taper my way down after a severe manic bout. Mania and depression is a mfer.  But I'm glad it's only been weeks instead of months.  

I've posted here a couple of times for support and it's been a great help.  Good luck to everyone working on their own struggles.

417,Hopped seltzer water may have just cured my drinking PERMANENTLY,"I've finished 8 days of no drinking, with only some moderate cravings.

I tried seltzer waters like Sprindrift and La Croix which I thought were 'meh'. I'm not huge into NA beers since a big reason for quitting drinking was to (1) save money (NA beers are EXPENSIVE!) and (2) lose weight (some NA beers still pack a lot of calories). 

Today I received a shipment of hopped seltzer water... and I cannot believe how good it is. You get 80% of the taste of an IPA, but zero calories and zero alcohol!! And the aftertaste/after-burps only have the delicious piney hops and none of the booze. As a former IPA addict this stuff hits the spot.

It's still on the pricier side but I have no idea how I just heard about this stuff a week ago. I don't want to mention the brand so this doesn't look like an AD but AFAIK there are only a few large brands out and they all seem highly rated.",t3_nzwyyh

423,Day 8! First week is down!,"Today I am officially through my first week (again) and it feels so good to be getting to those small milestones (again). Around this time last year I started to realize I would most likely have to cut out drinking permanently, but I wasn't sure how or when it would really stick. I did go almost 90 days last summer but I wasn't honest enough with the people around me about how serious I was. That allowed me to go back on my promise way easier because I was the only person who really knew I wanted to stop for real. 

I am completely certain that this is the trajectory my life needs to take in order for me to realize my full potential. The cravings start to dim when I try to remember what I want to see myself accomplish. I know for a fact I will never get to where I want to be if alcohol has any role in my life. Moderation is a big fat lie I wanted to believe in for too long. 

I am someone who often struggles with self doubt and uncertainty but in this I am certain. I can't wait to keep you guys updated as this journey continues. 

Thank you all for being here, it's fucking beautiful what we can all do for each other.

426,Almost slipped after 4.7 years,"I came close to drinking this past week again. We took a family vacation for the first time in a long time and had a few meals at a local brewery. I'd been craving beer a lot lately. I started rationalizing.

- People have been drinking beer for centuries
- Maybe I can handle it better now
- I could drink just beer—not hard alcohol
- ...maybe an occasional Scotch, socially
- I should be able to moderate, like ""normal"" people
- etc.

These are the same rationalizations I made before. Nothing has changed. My brain is lying to me again. Fuck.

The past 18 months have been... challenging. Really, really, hard. I don't know if I'd have made it without sobriety. There's a good chance I'd have drank myself to death.

Today I've been sober 1724 days. I will make it to 5 years and beyond. While I'm not very active here, this place is an important part of my life, and I'm thankful for you all.

At the end of my drinking regime, I was drinking a ten pack or two of fireball shooters, and however much I could finish out of a box of wine before I passed out. Crippling depression, severe anxiety. Something finally clicked for me about 9 months ago and here I am. Yes I had withdrawal, yes it was tough. And the first week was a mental rollercoaster until I discovered seltzers. I don't know what it is but they just make everyday easier for me. Someone posted on here a while back that they had a drinking problem, not just alcohol but the amount of liquids they consume, and I 💯 have the same issue.

How is this legal? Why did we draw the line and say this is not allowed with marijuana and tobacco, but alcohol advertising ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE is the status quo?

433,Resilience,"This text reached me and I share in hopes it might resonate with you too. So many of us ask “How do we overcome?” or forgive ourselves or in some form or another. I thought this was pretty spot on;

“Resilience has something to do with clear-sightedness. We must recognize our circumstances. They cannot be ignored, and they will certainly inform what actions we take. However, I’ve come to realize that resilience has more to do with love and with the elusive concept of faith. Loving ourselves enough to do the next right thing, loving others enough to cultivate a sense of safety, loving the world enough to shine our light in our small corner of the universe. Faith that our actions matter, faith that all things pass and change, faith that the source of things is benevolent, and goodness is where we look for it.”- Conor, Tempest",t3_o052ko
434,I was only planning on two months of sobriety but I’ve decided I’m going to stay sober and it’s because of my husband.,"My husband and I were winding down after our friends going away party and we were talking about random stuff and I was like ugh I’m so tired and he was like I’m tired too! And I said “yeah but I’m over here stone cold sober!!” and he replied “I like sober you.” 

And I was like...? So taken aback? A huge part of our (ten year long) relationship has been drinking together. Going to events specifically based around drinking, places that are alcohol-centric, etc. I never would have thought he would prefer me sober. I was actually really torn when I quit drinking because I felt like I’d be losing that part of our relationship.

I asked him if I was different sober and he definitely didn’t mean to say it out loud but he says I am. That I do more stuff and am nicer to him and other people (so upsetting. I didn’t mean to be mean to anyone ever). And he said “I feel like you have more problems in general when you’re drinking” and I think that’s actually fair. And I asked him “so you wouldn’t care if I quit drinking forever?” And he was basically like “absolutely not. Do whatever feels right for you.”

So: IWNDWYT! ❤️❤️❤️

435,Coming back here really helps knock down some barriers...,"I have been on this site for a couple of years now.  Sometimes posting, sometimes reading, sometimes upvoting.  This is probably the most positive place on the internet.  Coming here and reading what you all put down reminds me, really reminds me, that this stuff is real.  It is not just in my head.  That alcohol is real.  That dealing with it is a real situation that A LOT of folks deal with and have struggles with.  That I am most certainly not alone.  That when I think about what people write here, others are thinking about what I write.  Alcohol is not a thing that defines us.  It is a part of us.  Or was.  Or still is.  Or may be again, but then we move forward from there.  Being sober is not just not drinking.  The sober person cares about others and puts energy into helping other folks out.  A type of self gratification through service.  It helps us sleep well at night.  Sometimes I forget things like that and get too caught up in my own head.  Coming here helps me see that my own struggles and thoughts are just as tangible in their own ways in other people's lives as they are in mine.  Bring here helps me feel connected and a part of something real.  Even if it is just conversation  The conversation is real and so are the people on the other end of the screen.

436,First night,"Hey guys, 

Long time lurker first time poster. I have been drinking every night since I graduated college. I am now 30 so it has been almost a decade. I joined this subreddit when I had my first daughter. She just turned 1. Dads need to be responsible and protective, not stumbling to bed on a Wednesday night. I overdid it last night and made my wife cry. My daughter was asleep but I just thought about what she would think of her father if she saw me like this. I right then went through the whole house and collected all my alcohol and threw it away in our garage trashcan. We had just gone to Costco that day so I have one and a half handles of rum, 24 beers and some wine sitting outside. I am laying awake realizing alcohol was how I fell asleep and willing myself not to pick it out of the trash. It is collected Wednesday morning and my house will officially be alcohol free. Could use some encouragement until this isn’t an option!

439,Shins hurt?,"I posted earlier but this is totally different. I’m SUPER hungover but trying to drink water and Gatorade and whatever but..

My shins hurt like hell?! Like I can tell it’s not my skin or the bone, it is definitely my shin muscles in pain (calves feel fine, which makes this extra weird to me). Laying in bed is fine, I don’t really feel it until I stand or walk. Pretty obvious when I do stand/walk though. WTF??

Also I tried to post this about 45 mins ago and my toes went numb, but phone died so I couldn’t post. I’m a very “placebo affect” type person though so pretty sure the fact that when I realized “oh, phone is dead. Can’t post for 10-20 mins”, and my toes weren’t numb after like 3 mins of that realization, I think that’s probably not a real symptom of anything, lol. Hopefully at least. 

Shins still hurt though. This has to be from alcohol but I’m so confused? My shins feel like someone used them as a punching bag. Not shooting pain, just REALLY sore and weak feeling. 

I guess im just asking for opinions? Idek

Edit: 99% sure it’s dehydration. The “physical reason” comments make sense, but I didn’t do anything physical yesterday. At all. I barely walked to my kitchen or bathroom (don’t think I even did that actually). And there are no external injuries. No bruises, scratches, ANYTHING. So, gotta be dehydration.

Glad to have an answer. Also JFC drink water bc I didn’t know you could be in his much pain (aside from headaches and nausea) from drinking. Currently trying to figure out what shoes I’ll wear to the office tomorrow cause no way I can walk in heels. omfg. Ugh.",t3_o06dfm

I want the illusion of peace of mind and confidence and self-assuredness and certainty that alcohol brings.  I guess in real life I do not want the illusion.  I want the reality.  It is hard because a lot of my peace of mind is based on other people's happiness around me.  I am a people pleaser.  Do not get me wrong, I am quite happy with my life but all the same the stress of other people close to me suffering or people who get upset at work (I work in a very public service oriented profession) really hits home.  It is hard for me not to take things personally and the alcohol helps with the anxiety.  Started as fun and unique and became routine.  Like a person training for a marathon.  You do not start out with a 12 pack a day (I no longer do that but want far more control over the habit than I have, meaning I probably need to leave it all behind anyway) but you can build up to it.  A lot of things I cannot control but really wish did not have to happen to folks.  Transference is a big deal and is something I try to work on.  Getting to something like an other side of COVID is also a big deal.  I have not been exercising or been in my healthy routines as much as I normally would have been this last year-and-a-half and getting that started again is daunting and feels exhausting.

A few years ago, I got rock bottom in my life after the death of a family member and almost drank myself into the grave. I made the decision to quit drinking and was sober for over two years.

I thought I could have a drink and only drink in this circumstance or that, but over time it evolved into an almost every night ordeal. Usually about 500ml of whisky (or 10 shots). Lately, It's been hard to keep my head on straight. I'm not sure if it was the depression that made me stay drinking more heavily, or the drinking that brought on the depression that has me stuck in a loop. It doesn't really matter... I want to be, and will be sober. I can't say if I'll never ever drink again in my life, but I know it won't be today.

455,How have you dealt with the loneliness of lost friendships?,"I have been actively trying to be alcohol free for about a month now. I had a small slip up and am on day 8.

Since being more present I've been dealing with a lot of sad feelings over the friendships I've lost in the last couple of years, specifically this past year when I was a drunken mess and a very hurtful person.

I know these bridges are burned, I was forgiven one too many times and the forgiveness is not welcome anymore. My question is how to move on and make new friends and amends with what is the past?

I still have friends, two of my closest live out of state but it hurts to log onto venmo and see people went out to pizza and I would not be thought of. I want to surround myself with a better positive group. Just don't know where to start.

Thanks for reading and offering advice in advance.",t3_o01tti
456,Worried about being honest with the doctor.,"Hi all, hope you are doing well today.


I have a physical coming up this week, and I'd like to finally be honest about my drinking habits, but I'm really worried about how that may affect my health insurance. I've been keeping track this year, and I've drank on average about three days a week - often only one or two drinks, but often binging, also. I didn't really keep track of how much per day, only if I did or didn't drink. I'm relatively young, and otherwise pretty healthy so I'm not super worried about liver damage, but I did have a worrisome blood pressure measurement at my dentist's lately (after a couple days of drinking heavy) that I assume is due to alcohol.

Does anyone have experience with insurance rates going up in response to telling the doc how much you drink? I've heard that telling the doctor you smoke increases your insurance rates, but I'm not sure if it's the same for alcohol.

Obviously I know I should just be honest regardless of how it may impact my finances, but I wouldn't be asking this if I wasn't more worried about insurance rates than I am my health. Thanks everyone!",t3_o01sq7

459,Day 9 - and my first outing around alcohol,"Hello friends.  I’m an alcoholic, only just recently admitted that to myself and my loved ones, like 9 days ago. I now know I cannot drink safely and that I can never drink again.  

Yesterday was my first day out of the house since my own rock bottom 10 days ago. And thus, it was also my first time around alcohol.  My sports team had our first practice of the season. And of course a few had beers after.  

I knew this would happen, so I was ready for it.  I was nervous going to practice because of this. But also wanted to get out and play. 

It was fine. I was just kinda sad. Sad thinking I can never have a beer again after practice, which I loved to do.  But what I know now, is that one refreshing beer after practice always turns into 2 or 3.  And then when I get home, that turns into a half bottle of bourbon.  Every single time. 

So yesterday I faced a new challenge and won. Being sad is ok, drinking every night is not ok.  And this morning I awoke feeling fresh, not hungover and no longer sad. 

Thank you everyone here for all your support. It helps tremendously. 

Standing tall and strong with all of us.",t3_nzpgj6
460,Day 1 again after 22 days !,"What can I say, I screwed up Sunday night. I'm going to ask my Dr. for Naltrexone and start trying different support groups.",t3_o005r0
461,Guess I'm staying sober?,"Hi all, first time poster here. I'm just over a year sober and I guess I identify as an alcoholic. I started drinking while I was in an abusive relationship and maintained the habit through two more abusive relationships after that lol. My drinking got pretty bad at times, not like life wrecking bad, but bad enough to hurt. 

I've ""gone sober"" temporarily a bunch of times, always for a set period of time (usually for a couple of months at most) and that's always been pretty easy for me to do. I've had withdrawals most of those times, but it was mentally easy for me to say ""I'm just not drinking right now because I'm waiting for x date to start again."" 

At the start of the pandemic I was drinking a lot. I worked from home as a teacher and lived with my roommate at the time. I'm not going to blame anything on my roommate, but they were a heavy drinker and I think we egged each other on, so I was usually having at least 5 or 6 drinks every day, if not more. Shots of tequila and beers every night all night. I was still in grad school, now during a global pandemic...somewhere between the stress of my life and the physical/psychic toll of drinking, I was doing pretty bad. I woke up every morning with a very intense feeling of pure dread. I was definitely suicidal during that time (not a first for me but this was worse than other times). 

I could feel that the alcohol was largely to blame, so I stopped, and promised myself I wouldn't start again until I could ""safely walk into a bar and order a beer."" I was extremely careful during the pandemic, am now vaccinated, and I guess I could go into a bar now if I wanted to. But I haven't.

Once it was safe to do it, I traveled out of state to reunite with my long lost Grandma. I hadn't seen her in literally 20 years. We reconnected really powerfully, I'm so thankful to have her in my life again. When I got there, her ranch hand/best friend (it's an interesting relationship lol) offered me a beer, and she told him I couldn't have one because I'm sober. I had been thinking about having one once I got there, but that moment felt pretty pivotal. Ranch hand then told me that he's 21 years sober and still goes to AA regularly. We got to talk about that, he asked me about my triggers and stuff. 

I don't know quite how to describe how this all made me feel, but here I am a few weeks later, still sober. Perhaps indefinitely! It's hard to imagine Never Drinking Again, but all I know is that not drinking makes me feel better than drinking. I miss something about drinking sometimes, but when I try to pin that something down, I'm not sure what it is. The taste? Maybe, because I find that I actually kind of enjoy non-alcoholic beer lol. Sometimes I feel like I'm being silly because I could probably just drink ""a little bit"" or ""normally"" if I really tried. I could just drink on the weekends, and not keep any alcohol at home. It's kind of a constant effort to remember how much better it feels for me to have my wits about me, and to not be slowly poisoning myself. 

Will I have to make a hard decision to Never Drink Again in order to stay sober, or can I continue like this? Have I already made a decision deep down? It's tough because I come from a family of drinkers. Should I go to AA since no one in my immediate social circle has gone through this sobriety thing? These are the questions...

This is super long, not sure if anyone will read it, but thanks if you do. Feels good just to put it into words.",t3_nzvzin
462,I screwed up.,Drank yesterday. I need to get into real recovery not this white knuckle attempt at being a dry drunk.

463,I was the Queen of Antacids - anyone else?,"Before and after drinking, I used to gulp Tums and coat my stomach with Gaviscon or other liquid antacid, so the drinking would be less irritating. 

I had antacids at home, at work, in my purse, in my car.  I would go to the drugstore every month and replenish supplies.  It helped make the drinking ""OK.""  Or so I told myself.
I was too stupid to realize that overuse of antacids can also cause stomach upset.  Plus all the money I was spending on both the alcohol and the antacids...ugh.

Now I'm free of both.  I actually recently THREW OUT the now-expired large bottle of Tums!!  Yeah, baby!

Just another benefit I hadn't figured on.",t3_nzsh64
464,Tapering with weed,"I'm on day 5 of no booze. I don't have access to treatment at the moment. I just stopped. I've been using small amounts of weed in the evening to take the edge off from withdrawals.  I don't want to continue smoking weed but I don't want to suffer either. I figured I would knock off the weed this Friday and give myself the weekend to adjust. For now it eases the anxiety and helps my appetite.  Do any of you have any experience with this?  I know the AA party line on weed so I'm not looking for a lecture about how I'm ""not sober"".  If I had access to treatment they would have out me on benzos which are highly addictive and no one would judge me. I say this because a guy at  meeting Friday gave me shit about smoking weed to taper off booze. Thanks.",t3_nzthue

473,My Wife Had Friends Over For Drinks,"I'm subbed to this subreddit on my main account, I lurk and upvote but don't post.  I'm almost 23 months sober.  I don't normally need to post, but I need to at least write this out.  If this is against the sub rules, fine, delete, whatever.  Like I've said I just need to type something out.

It used to be that my wife and I would regularly have our friends over for drinks and to just hang out and stuff.  But as our social group has gotten older we've all been settling down and having kids and seeing each other less and less.  And with COVID we didn't really see each other much for the past year and three months.

So a bit about me.  Before COVID hit, I knew I had a drinking problem.  Like I said, I'm almost 23 months sober.  I've known I've had a drinking problem for a long time.  Before me and my wife even started dating, even.  When my wife got pregnant I cut my drinking back to only drinking on Fridays and Saturdays.  I was a shit partner and dad on weekends being hung over or drunk all the time.  

Well, on my thirtieth birthday I almost succeeded in destroying my life and myself.  My wife hated me and was heartbroken.  My parents found out and were heartbroken and disappointed, too.  I knew I had to stop drinking entirely.  My wife gave the ultimatum that I stop and get help or she'd leave me.  My parents basically said the same thing.

So I started going to meetings.  I found this subreddit and started lurking.  I went to meetings until COVID hit and I didn't feel like it was safe to go anymore.  The AA groups that I attended weren't a perfect fit for what I needed, anyway.  But I've remained sober.  

And, honestly, during the pandemic it's been easy for me to remain sober.  There's been less of a need to go out and socialize.  I've been able to stay at home and enjoy time with my daughter and wife.  I've done my best to make up for my mistakes and become the father and partner that I want to be.

Well, last Friday my wife and three friends over for drinks.  Everyone's fully vaccinated, so I didn't see any harm in it.  I put our daughter to sleep, went down and said hey to everyone and went to hang out by myself.  It was a girls night kind of a thing.  I read some and went to bed.  

I woke up before anyone else on Saturday.  Early gray morning light of a humid and rainy late Spring morning.  I went downstairs to make coffee and start making something for breakfast and I saw the left over wine in the fridge.  And damn didn't I want to drink it.

It used to be on an early morning like that I'd be waking up hung over or still drunk and I'd polish off the bottle from the night before and then start rummaging for something else to drink.  I'm glad I didn't drink the wine, though.  But I really fucking wanted to.  Like for the first time since getting sober, I wanted it.

But every time I open the fridge I see it there and it tempts me.  My wife isn't much of a drinker so that bottle will probably sit in there until there's a sale at the grocery store and we stock up on something that needs the space in the fridge.  I guess I'll try to hide it and ignore it.

I don't want to actually drink it.  I don't want to be drunk.  I want to be a good father and partner.  I want to even be a good worker who isn't posting to reddit during work hours about this shit.  I just needed to be able to post this somewhere and get this off of my mind.

Thank you to everyone else who posts on here and for the community of this subreddit.  Thanks for taking the time to red this if you have.  Sorry if this isn't a proper kind of post for here.

474,I made a joke this morning about how I can’t drink anymore…,"And my husband responded, “Well you *can* drink, if you want to” and I said, “but it’ll make me depressed, then I’ll be a bad mom.”

He’s 100% my support system through this, and sometimes I wonder if he doesn’t realize how negatively alcohol was impacting my life before I quit.

I’m not the type of drinker who can’t stop once they start, I’m more the type who used alcohol to escape amy emotions &amp; traumas. 

I’m 19 months sober, and a new mom to a 10 month old. 

For some reason, his comment made me feel like “yeah, I *could* drink” even though I really don’t want to, because I refuse to put my kid in a compromising situation.  (I had alcoholic parents).

476,The problem as a functional alcoholic,"So this past Friday I finally realized I need to quit what I'm doing. I'm spending like 100 bucks a day out at bars (I LOVE the bar scene, but it isn't even at night, it's during the day). My job allows me to drink while I'm working as I can do all my functions from my laptop without having to really talk to anyone, and even when I do have to talk to people via meetings, they can't tell I'm drunk because I rarely have to say anything and they can't smell me. And I make a ton of money, which I think is another reason people aren't telling me to quit. It's like, hey, you can support a family of 6 and still have hundreds of dollars to spend drinking, and hundreds of dollars to do other stuff every week, while still affording a bunch of toys and expensive stuff. I feel like the people around me see that and think I'm handling life fine even though I'm drunk all the time.

This wasn't really an issue when I was going into the office, but my drinking has become a real issue. I pinched a nerve very close to my brain a year ago and because doctors refused to prescribe me any strong pain medication to block it, I started drinking, because that would actually make the pain tolerable. 

Well, the pinched nerve corrected itself (after 10 months), but even the last 2 months my drinking hasn't wavered. The messed up thing is that I don't drink, AT ALL, on weekends unless my wife and I go out with friends.

I essentially only drink from like Noon/1 PM - 3/4 PM, not even every weekday, like sometimes it'll just be Wed-Fri, but every now and then I'll buy a bottle or two from the store and keep drinking even when my family is home and I've realized it's a real problem when I know I have almost no responsibilities at work for a couple of days and my lunch drinking turns into a 24 hour affair.

Suicidal ideation, burning every bridge that I have built, just insane ranting about politics and society via text messages......

I can't do it any more. Like 0 alcohol for any reason whatsoever. I haven't had a drink since last Friday and I plan on keeping it going.

Oh, other issues, I only smoke when I'm drunk. I never smoke when I'm sober, so we have a double whammy right there. SOMEHOW I haven't managed to completely isolate myself and for the most part everyone in my life still supports me and hardly any of them care if I'm drinking as long as I'm not doing it around them, but before I die from it I need to keep myself on the task and not rely on any of them. I literally had to tell my wife she needs to leave me if I have another drink of alcohol, EVER. I didn't have my first taste of alcohol until I was 21, so I went 21 years without ever doing, plus another couple years in my late 20s, but at this point I feel like I've been drinking at least 3 days a week for the past 7 years. And I don't just have a couple, I binge for 3 hours, like clockwork.

So today, I'm not going to drink with you.",t3_nzml53

I have a hugely stressful job and it’s really hard to get through all week without having my ususal 2-3 drinks a night.

481,Today my dog passed,"Today, the companion I got when I first moved out of my parents house (11 years ago) took his final breath. Sobriety has had its struggles, but not today. Today, I was so grateful that I was able to feel all the feelings that came with losing him rather than being numb to them. Death is the final stage of many relationships and I feel like I’d be doing his memory a disservice if I weren’t feeling all the feelings I am feeling right now. 

Finn was there from the start. The good times and the bad. The sober times and the not so sober times. I read a mantra somewhere that we should be the person that our dog thinks we are. And as I got sober in January, I carried that with me. He was with me at rock bottom and I wanted to show him how much I appreciated that. So these last few months (I quit drinking in January) have been a blast with him. He was 11 years old, but up until this morning was a pretty active guy. He had been coming with me on the first part of my runs as I train for a half marathon- getting outside and spending quality time together more frequently than we had in 2-3 years. I’m sad I wasted so much of the time I had with him drinking on the couch. I’m grateful he got to see things change though. Whenever I used to leave the house I’d say “be good. I love you.” He passed in my arms as I rushed him to the vet this morning. I always told him to please go out on his own terms so I don’t have to make the call- and the fact that he held on until I woke up and got him to the vet felt like it was him being the one saying “be good. I love you.”

I have no desire to drink today and I miss my dog so much. If you find yourself drinking to numb yourself, I ask you to consider the idea that sometimes the really hard emotions really make us feel alive. 

Rest easy Finn.

The wife thinks I gave it up 2 years ago...she’d be devastated to know I’ve had numerous relapses in that time. 

I do a good job of hiding it, but it takes all my energy. Any second I get alone I calculate how much time I have and if it’s enough for me to slip out to the liquor store and drink enough before anyone gets home.

I have a son that’s a year old and I swore to myself that I’d get this figured out by the time he was born. I don’t want him growing up like I did with a drunk father.

483,"Sunday, and I F***ed up","Sundays are my hardest day. My mom has Alzheimer's and my dad has terminal pancreatic cancer. On Sunday's I go to my mom's care home and help her eat breakfast, because she can't feed herself. Then I go back to help her eat lunch. Then I drive to my dad's house, pick him up and take him to visit my mom. Then, later, I take him back home.

Now, note that these people have been my rock, my idols, my only heroes my whole life. They have been through countless trials and have stayed loyal and married for over 60 years. There is nobody more deserving of a good, peaceful, old age than them. They have never ceased loving me, my brother, our families, or especially each other.

So...to see them suffer. To see my dad, who could do anything, fix anything, solve anything, work his way through anything, be out of breath just putting on his shoes, that shit tears me up. To see my mom, who was an educator, who trained other teachers, who loved to read and learn and was constantly curious about life, look at me with a blank stare and drool food down her chin. Then look at me and say, ""I hate you."" That shit fucking tears me up.

So today, after 3 good days. I came home and had a drink. Yes, it felt good...

So thankfully it scared me enough that I feel I just absolutely cannot have another drink or I’ll risk dying or ending up in the hospital.

487,Finally deciding to stay off the drink.,"I'm a 24 year old lad and for years I've always gone out drinking with my mates, any excuse for a piss up and we were on it, like most young people do.

But whenever I drink I get too carried away and make the most stupid decisions, putting my self in danger and also ruining relationships with girlfriends. Every single relationship I've been in so far has been ruined by me getting blackout drunk too often, one ended after a boozy night and I cheated on her, I know I shouldn't blame alcohol, but it's not something I would have done if not under the influence.

This Saturday just past was the last time I'll ever drink, one of my best friends and I got into a physical fight, we beat eachother up pretty badly over nothing, nothing like this has ever happened before as we've been working together for years. I spent a night in hospital with a concussion, had stitches in my lip and chin, and have pretty bruised ribs. I feel embarrassed though more than anything, we both do. But we're glad neither of us were injured more seriously.

We have both spoken to eachother since and managed to settle our differences, realising we were just being dickheads, typical Brits having a beer to many on a night out 🙄

So hopefully, even though we had a rough weekend, we'll both be able to stay off the drink, if anything good came out of this it would be staying sober.

491,Not what I expected..,"I have a problem with alcohol and I know it. I don't blackout when I drink but I can't just drink one drink. I only drink on weekends but I think about it while I'm not drinking. I want it so badly when anything bad happens I try to have other coping mechanisms but its just the one that works best.

I've been working on my mental health for at least 6 or 7 years now working with counselors, therapists, doctors, and have tried many different medications at different dosages.. Alcohol is the only thing that makes me feel okay.

To get to the point, I opened up to my husband today about how I've been feeling that there's no help for me and that I've been relying on alcohol to make me feel better but I've been trying for the last year to limit heavily my alcohol intake. He said that I've been doing really well not drinking too much and that if alcohol is my medicine maybe I should just accept it and keep going.

Wtf am I supposed to do now? I still want to stop but he basically gave me the green light and supports my drinking. I thought he would understand that this isn't the way I should be dealing with things. I need to hear other things.",t3_nzzc6b
492,I’m finally admitting I have a problem and told some people in real life,"Deep down I’ve known my drinking was problematic for several years. In fact I’ve never been able to drink sensibly, but I could brush a lot of it off as being young, as being a party girl. But now I’m in my 30s and most of my friends are married with kids, my behaviour sticks out more. It’s no longer a ‘wild night’, it’s worrying - having strangers call me an ambulance, passing out in the street, having my partner stay up all night watching me, terrified, as I keep vomiting without waking up and he’s scared I’ll choke… not that any of that behaviour would’ve been ok when I was younger, it’s just now it feels far more obviously problematic. But I still would brush it off. 

But then the pandemic hit, and my drinking intensified. I couldn’t work, couldn’t go anywhere, so why not? I could finally drink the way I always wanted to! Heavily and constantly. I’ll stop when I go back to work, obviously.

But I couldn’t. I have cut down since being back at work, I hardly drink in the day anymore and I don’t drink at work. So was still fooling myself that I had it under control. But I drink most evenings and when I start I can’t stop. I usually go until I pass out, no matter the consequences, no matter what I’m supposed to be doing the next day.  At that moment it doesn’t matter. I feel anxious before I start drinking, really jittery the whole day until I can finally have a drink. 

I’ll then tell myself that tonight it really will be just one or two. I’ve just had a stressful day and need something to help me unwind. But before I know it is 2am and I’m absolutely wasted and arguing with my partner because I’m ruining his life now as well as mine. I really don’t know why he sticks around sometimes - I don’t deserve him.

So the last few months the little voice in my head that tells me this isn’t ok has been getting harder and harder to silence. I’m having more and more trouble brushing it off. I’m financially in the shit, my relationship is in danger and I hate myself a little bit more each day.

The last few weeks I’ve posted a bit here and got such amazing support. I’ve only managed to string a few sober days together at a time, but it’s a start. And this weekend I finally admitted to my partner and to a friend that I have a problem and that I’m going to get help. They were both incredibly supportive and now I’ve said it out loud to people in my real life, it feels more real. Hopefully that’ll mean it’s harder to go back on.

Now I need to figure out my next steps. I am going to try and call my GP (who I haven’t been able to get hold of since before Covid) and hopefully make an appointment.

Thank you again everyone for your support. I very much mean this: IWNDWYT ❤️",t3_nzkov1

494,Social events/being social without alcohol?,"I know this is probably a frequently asked question, but I was wondering what are your guys' inputs are on social events, at least for young adults? I feel like everytime I meet people my age, the go to thing is drinking as a social event. I feel like a party pooper everytime I say I don't want to drink, or end up not being invited to other social events.

 I recently moved to a new area, and wanted to explore the scene a little.  It's a pretty big college area in a big town, so there are plenty of bars and such. I've just been frequenting cafes in the meantime, just to get out, but I feel like the best way to meet new people is during the night on weekends. Alcohol used to be a daily part of my life, and now it's been a good few months since I've drank any alcohol (maybe a glass of wine on a date), and much longer since I've even got to the point were I was drunk. I don't want to expose or 'test' myself by going to a bar if I don't have to, and I don't wanna feel pressured to drink either.",t3_nzz51x
495,Finding someone new after quitting,"My previous relationship ended because of my drinking and the direct and indirect effects my drinking had on our life. It was three years ago.

I realised then that I can’t (or didn’t want to) be without alcohol, and if I wanted to find a new girlfriend to have a good relationship with, she would basically have to put up with my drinking. So she would have to be an equal drunk, or be a girl who is in a lousy relationship with a drunk. I didn’t want to pursue either of those options, so I haven’t tried to find anyone. I had some casual things going on but grew tired of those as well. They weren’t leading anywhere, just comfort for loneliness.

Now I’m working genuinely with quitting and man, I feel so out of place after daily drinking of three years. Obviously a lot of things to fix. Finding someone who cares to enter this mess of a life feels like a distant dream. I know it’s still early, the reality just hits hard sometimes.

I hope I can turn this life around. My addiction with alcohol has been a lonely hell.

496,Not sure what to do,"Struggling emotionally as I’m back on the wagon on my 6th day after being sober for 15 days in years. I need more support with community, but I’ve had a bad experience with AA of someone being predatory after my first meeting at that location a few years ago. This person zeroed in on me, and was clearly checking me out, as well as telling me they were going away but that we should hang when they got back. It was essentially a sexual energy they were giving off. 

I’m struggling with over all trust issues surrounding my safety, and that on top of it isn’t helping. I wish pple weren’t creepy in such a sensitive group of pple given the circumstances, and wish pple weren’t creepy in general. 

I’m gonna look into a more specific group of aa, but does anyone know of different kinds of support groups outside of SD and aa?",t3_o01jak

Happy Monday everyone. I tried so damn hard to find that whole presentation I made for PAWS for my local addictions service years ago. Since I cannot find what I did myself, I googled and found a great resource. So today is about PAWS. Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms

&amp;#x200B;

Whether mildly unpleasant or seriously uncomfortable, withdrawal symptoms come with the territory when you're in early recovery from alcohol or other drug addiction. In fact, post-acute withdrawal symptoms that persist or pop up during the first months of recovery can become a risk factor for relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

We asked clinicians at the Hazelden Betty Ford addiction treatment centers to discuss post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS): the cause, warning signs, duration and coping strategies. Here's what you need to know about the process of drug and alcohol withdrawal, including acute withdrawal symptoms and post-acute syndrome.

&amp;#x200B;

What is post-acute withdrawal syndrome?

Following medically supervised detox from alcohol, opiates, marijuana, cocaine, benzodiazepines or other highly addictive substances, most people experience a short phase of physical discomfort, otherwise known as acute withdrawal. Symptoms often include muscle ache, nausea, headache and increased heart rate. Acute withdrawal can produce more dangerous health consequences—even life-threatening complications—if detox isn't done in a supervised setting. But there's more to drug and alcohol withdrawal than physical symptoms of discomfort. While acute withdrawal refers primarily to the body's process of healing, a second phase of withdrawal symptoms, known as post-acute withdrawal syndrome, or PAWS, occurs as the brain recalibrates after active addiction. These symptoms, unlike the first stage of acute withdrawal, typically involve more of the psychological and emotional aspects of withdrawal. Depending on the duration and intensity of alcohol or other drug addiction, this secondary withdrawal syndrome can occur a few weeks into recovery or a few months down the road. More important, even though PAWS is a temporary condition, the symptoms can become a driving factor in relapse. This is true even for people who are fully committed to staying clean and sober.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do we experience post-acute withdrawal in recovering from substance abuse?

Post-acute withdrawal, whether mild or serious, is a necessary process in early recovery from alcohol or other drug dependence. Think of the withdrawal syndrome as the brain's way of correcting the chemical imbalances suffered during active addiction. PAWS occurs most commonly and intensely among individuals with alcohol and opioid addiction, as well as in people with addiction to benzodiazepines (or ""benzos,"" which are commonly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and panic attacks), heroin (an opiate) or medically prescribed pain medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

When does post-acute withdrawal syndrome occur?

Often, symptoms are triggered by stress or brought on by situations involving people, places or things that remind the individual of using. Many people in recovery describe the symptoms of PAWS as ebbing and flowing like a wave or having an ""up and down"" roller coaster effect. In the early phases of abstinence from substance use, symptoms can change by the minute. As individuals move into long-term recovery from alcohol or drug dependence, the symptoms occur less and less frequently.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the most common symptoms of PAWS?

In order to minimize the risk of relapse, it's important to recognize that many of the unpleasant or uncomfortable sensations and feelings you experience in early recovery could be symptoms of PAWS. It's also important to understand that PAWS symptoms are temporary. Here are some of the most common symptoms:

&amp;#x200B;

Foggy thinking/trouble remembering 

Urges and cravings

Irritability or hostility

Sleep disturbances—insomnia or vivid dreams

Fatigue

Issues with fine motor coordination

Stress sensitivity

Anxiety or panic

Depression

Lack of initiative

Impaired ability to focus

Mood swings 

Can post-acute withdrawal syndrome be avoided?

While avoidance of post-acute withdrawal syndrome isn't possible, you can effectively manage your symptoms. By learning to successfully manage post-acute and acute withdrawal symptoms, you will feel better physically and emotionally, improve your self-esteem and reduce the risk of relapse.

&amp;#x200B;

How long do PAWS symptoms usually last?

Most symptoms last for a few days at a time, although this is dependent on the type of alcohol or drug addiction, and the amount and frequency of substance use (every person's withdrawal pattern is a little different). Typically, the brain recalibration process takes anywhere from six months to two years before the brain once again naturally produces endorphins and dopamine.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some coping strategies for getting through PAWS?

Here are 10 practical tips for successfully managing the symptoms of post-acute withdrawal syndrome:

&amp;#x200B;

Make appointments with mental health professionals for both psychiatric and psychological care.

Be good to yourself. Practice self-care by eating well, exercising, avoiding trigger situations when possible and establishing positive, supportive relationships.

Talk about what you're experiencing with your Twelve Step peers, sponsor, counselor, therapist or family—anyone who will not criticize or minimize your experiences.

Review the events that precede a flare-up of your PAWS symptoms, and think about how you reacted. If you know what to expect, you won't be caught off-guard the next time the situation arises.

Consider starting a journal to document your experiences and identify alternative ways of responding.

If you're having a hard time concentrating, limit the amount of time you spend on any one task to no more than 15 minutes.

Interrupt the circular thinking cycle by doing something different (talk to a friend, listen to music, go for a walk).

If you have problems remembering, write things down or set up reminders on your phone.

If insomnia is a problem, limit the amount of caffeine used before bedtime and try to establish a sleep routine by going to bed at the same time every night and waking up at the same time each morning (this helps your circadian rhythm).

Be realistic. You can't hurry recovery. Yes, you'll have some bad days. Try to remember ""this, too, shall pass."" The symptoms are part of your recovery journey and proof that you're making progress.

499,1 Year without a drink,"Made it 1 year.  It's hard to believe...and in many ways this last year went by both slower and faster than I recall.  I stopped drinking because of a bad liver -- and though I already have Cirrhosis, I know that stopping drinking saved my life.   

I managed to navigate the pandemic-hell by focusing on staying sober, eating health, and working out.  I'm now 50 pounds lighter, clear headed, way more fit...can actually climb 5-6 flights of stairs without getting winded...and look now look forward to many more years without the drink.

Stopping drinking was the best decision I made for myself, and I'm with you all who continue with the challenge of staying sober in a drink-friendly world.

500,First Sober weekend in?,"I treated myself to my first sober weekend in a long, long time.  Been drinking a lot.  This drinking habit no longer serves me.  

Observations.  

My Friday went until midnight!  Maxed it out.  I did some extra work and made some connections that evening that I never would have on a professional level, because I would typically be snoring off a long evening of booze by around 9PM.  

I woke Saturday tired from staying up late (and not sleeping all that well) but didn't have a hangover!   
 Wow!  That gave me a ton of energy.  I made my kids breakfast, I did some chores and then I took a nap!  Went to a social event and didn't drink.  Ate good food and enjoyed myself.

Sunday - same, slept a little better and had more energy all day.  Worked in my yard until dark last night.  It is amazing all the time you get back AND waste - drinking.  That was my most amazing takeaway.  

Monday - (slept good) woke up and made a healthy lunch to take to work!  Would normally be sucking down coffee and dragging.

502,"When I'm not drinking, I feel like I'm the person I'm 'supposed' to be.","I'm interested to know if this resonates with anyone else here. As I near 100 days alcohol free, one strange effect that I have been noticing is a connection with my sense of self. The best way I could put it is that I feel like I am a more 'authentic' version of myself.

The past 15 years or so have been riddled with alcohol. And looking back on it, it feels like at times, that I was living as someone else. Someone that is so far from my identity that I have a hard time rationalizing that I am still that same person.

Now that I'm living alcohol free, I feel this deep connection to the person that I was in elementary school and high school, before I developed a dependence on alcohol. I feel motivated, confident, and proud of the person that I am. I feel excited by possibility instead of being afraid of change. 

That's not to say that I don't connect with the version of myself that has existed for the past 15 years. From the outside looking in, I'm sure that many people here would be able to idenitfy that I was struggling with alcohol - but I feel that a lot of people I got to know over those years had no idea what I was dealing with. I made some amazing friendships that I am confident will persist into my new lease on life. But there was part of me that always felt like a fraud. I never believed in my ability to accomplish simple tasks and I was to afraid of failure to ever push my boundaries.

Trying to put it into words makes me feel like a crazy person. It's a weird form of cognitive dissonance. I feel like I have kind of lived as two different people in my life - and now I'm finally back to being the person I originally was.

There is a part of me that mourns the 15 years that I spent seduced by the bottle. But there is a part of me that anticipates the (hopefully) 5-6 decades I have left on this earth now that I understand how important it is not to lose myself as I continue on in life.",t3_nzeyxs

When I got out I got disability from the Army $1600 for PTSD and substance abuse (Alcohol). That allowed me to take certain risks, and use veterans programs to make me very success. I hate that I have to think my success is all because of one terrible event that defines me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VA still sends me money too. I don't even need the money anymore and have gotten better. I just want them to take their money for the PTSD and leave me alone. I've been sober again for 6 months, but everyday feels worse than the last. I feel like I don't deserve all the things I have.

515,42 days ago I bought my last 6 pack,"There was nothing special or particular about it. I wish i had an eventful quitting story, but rock bottom was truly just a cumulative shittiness that weighed on me constantly. 

This never ever happens, but I didn’t finish the 6 pack. The 2 IPAs that were left undrank sat in my fridge, and I had an internal battle in the morning as I had started to recently with the idea of drinking them the following morning. I had done it before, quickly chugged a strong beer in the morning to make my head tingle just enough to feel motivated to continue living. But I didn’t, and oddly enough I finally felt just a little bit repulsed at the idea of choking down this putrid liquid anymore. 

I had read the books, I lurked this sub. The information I needed to quit had already been in my brain for probably 8 months, but I was still drinking. This is just how I am, and I was the same with anything toxic for me. It just clicks when I’m finally ready. I was ready to put in work. 

It’s taking work to journal everyday, it took work to open up to my doctor, it took work to talk to my husband, it takes work to force myself to get off my ass and get my heart rate up everyday. But guess what? It also took work to drive myself to the store everyday for alcohol, it took work to hide my drinking and dispose of all the evidence constantly, it took work to be in a constant internal emotional battle, it took work to try to navigate my days with a crippling hangover. 

I was done putting work into the wrong shit. It won’t get better overnight, and I still have my figurative sobriety training wheels on. But life is EXPONENTIALLY better day to day than it has been in YEARS. 

Last night, I laughed so hard and so genuinely that my mother in law said “wow you’re a lightweight!” because she assumed I was drinking beer with everyone. Nope, just me. Sober, joyful, and myself. I watched as my brother in law drank the 2 IPAs from my last 6 pack.",t3_nzp5vz
516,Has Anyone Gotten Chills?,"Anyone experienced chills during withdrawal?  I'm at approximately 42-44ish hours since my last drink.  My mind is really slow and I'm having a lot of trouble focusing, but I also feel sudden chills every once in a while.  Just wondering if this is common?",t3_nzsl4x
517,Choose Your Hard,"Lately, a few people in the real world have asked me if sobriety is ""hard"", and I've been thinking a lot about that question over the last few days because it's a *really* good question. 

Is sobriety hard? Sure it is. Sustained sobriety takes dedication, perseverance, and a very strong sense of self. Society (and the alcohol conglomerates) *wants* you to drink - it's almost literally shoved down our throats. It takes a special kind of person to look at that pressure and say ""no thank you"". Furthermore, alcohol is literally an addictive substance and once you let it in, on some level your body is going to want more. Addiction affects every aspect of the human body on a physical, mental, and social level. Yep, sobriety can certainly be hard. 

However, you know what's harder? You guessed it. 

Alcohol creeps up on you. If you're anything like me, one day you're sitting happily in the ""social"" drinker category. Years later you wake up and realize that all of your drinking buddies are gone and you're sitting around drinking the cheap shit after everyone else has gone to bed. You might feel okay for the first drink (perhaps two), but eventually all of those feelings that you were trying to escape from come back harder, and with an added dose of alcohol-induced anxiety. 

So you drink more to escape from the anxiety and your body retaliates by producing even more of the stress chemicals, and suddenly it's not so manageable anymore. You look for something to blame; anything but the precious alcohol. Alcohol is supposed to *relieve* stress, right? That's the bill of goods we've been sold. It's no wonder so many of us take years to realize that alcohol might just have been the cause of our problems all along. 

There's a good reason we say that alcohol steals happiness from tomorrow. Sobriety doesn't suddenly make everything perfect (this subreddit is clear evidence of that). However, sustained, consistent sobriety gives your body and mind a fighting chance to tackle your problems instead of just covering them up. 

Sobriety is hard. Drinking is harder. **You have to choose your hard**.

518,Update. I'm Alive. Actually alive. Thanks for being humans with me.,"I posted here last year a repairable person. I don't usually do things like post about my life or even update what I have written but since this community popped into my head more than a few times I wanted to express this to the beautiful void.


My post history has my original post I think. Im going to read it after this if I feel up to it. I didn't end up quitting. I doubled down and got better at being a functioning alcoholic which I always had a hunch was never actually a real thing. Turns out I was right.

5 months ago I had a billy reuben score of 9, I had killed much of my liver and its all fatty. I was bloated, sleeping maybe 2 hours at a time and I never had energy, I couldn't eat or i'd become extremely tired, my nose had either gotten broken or I wore it down? my G.I was screwed.
I was ALWAYS tired even when I was nice and cozy 3/4 a bottle in I'd only have like a 30ish minute episode of actual energy. Cheating. Lying. Manipulation. Emotional abuse/Extortion.
Finally the girl I had been pretty much using to buy alcohol and for a place to live realized she was worth more than how I was treating her, wizened up, and left me.

 She did it beautifully though. Let me stay and arrange a way for my parents to retrieve me even after she found out I was emotionally and physically cheating. I was only with her for a few months but she was a sweet, caring, and thoughtful person that had no business being sucked up into my bullshit. Im sorry. you met me and I took and took to replace what I had lost or what I just wanted more of. And thank you I would be dead if you didn't have self respect.

Today I'm coming up on 4 and a half months.
 Everything is different. Im sober. I'm happy. I'm seeing my kids and enjoying it. I'm seeing my family and enjoying it.
I'm seeing my life and my goals and enjoying the challenges and progress.
I'm enjoying myself.
I liked who I was when I drank. The outgoing, being myself, wacky but fun and harmless.
Now I'm actually wacky, fun, and harmless.

I don't know if I'm ever going to drink again but I highly doubt it.
I had been drinking a bottle a day for about a year and a half. I literally forgot what being sober even felt like. And how awesome it feels compared to being damn near comatose. I forgot how to be mad when you're sober. Sad when you're sober. Happy, anxious, loved, irritated, just having an off day. All of it.

You all would show up on my feed, good days and bad ones, and when you did i'd think of the support, and the fact that even though you're just this person who shows up on my feed today, I am rooting for you far long than just today and i honestly felt that on my worst days all of you were still out there rooting for me.

I did this with the help of everyone single person who tried, succeeded, or just thought about quitting, and im not done yet.

Thank you all for being yourselves and helping me. IWNDWYT.",t3_nzh14t

I still like concerts, festivals, live music at bars etc and don’t want to kiss out on those fun adventures after corona because of not drinking (I lucky can control myself int hair environments with the Na drinks, without them then I’d be drinking).

525,My body battery needs to charge.,"I’ve always known I get a worse sleep when I drink, I mean we all do, right? It’s basic science. But it didn’t really click until recently- when I got a smart watch that tracks things like… sleep…..

As it turns out— every single night that I have had a drink-even if it’s only 2 or 3– I don’t end up “charging my body battery to 100%” meaning even if I slept for 8, 9, even 10 hours, my sleep was so restless and so erratic that it wasn’t an effective way to recharge. 

Seeing the data right in front of me, that I only get a good sleep on nights when I don’t drink, really hit differently. I feel so much better after choosing not to drink because my sleep is amazing!! The proof is in!! Cant argue with facts. So IWNDWYT- gotta charge my body battery.",t3_nzl7dk

527,Realization unlocked: I used to drink to punish myself.,"I was a binge drinker. 

People never knew I had a problem because I’d only drink on the weekends like everyone else. But what they didn’t know was after the first or second drink.. I continued drinking because somewhere deep down inside I felt like I deserved to be punished for the person that I was. 

The first would always feel amazing, the second would feel pretty good as well, but after that, I would continue on until I either blacked out, or there was nothing left to drink. 

Alcoholism runs deep in my family and every time I drank I felt like that little monster inside me would grow. And it would tell me what a shit person I was for allowing myself to drink the poison that has given my family and myself such grief. 

All I can say is I’m so glad I don’t have to worry about fighting that monster anymore.",t3_nzds6c

I can sometimes go a few weeks without drinking, but I always end up spiraling back. It's never been a question of *if*, only *when*. When that understanding finally crystallized in my mind, that's when I understood what ""loss of control"" really feels like. 

I tried for a long time to convince myself that it wasn't a problem. I'm shockingly good at keeping myself together, and not a lot of people know or even *suspect* that I might have a problem.

535,Acts of Kindness Monday – Brightening the day for a sick teenager,"Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

This week a group of construction workers paused their work to hold up a sign saying “Hi, Matteo!” and wave to a 17-year-old who is in the palliative care at the hospital across the street.

Matteo, who has been in the hospital with a rare brain tumour since Easter Sunday, loves construction and enjoys sitting by the window to watch what is going on at the site. The construction crew was originally planning to give him a tour of the site, but Matteo is too sick, so they switched their plans.

What an amazing way to bring a moment of joy and brightness to what I’m sure are long, dull days.

How about you? Is there an Act of Kindness you want to share this week?

Last night I was drinking and poured the last beer down the drain. Today may be day one but at least it is farther than day zero was last night. I have gone back to drinking nearly every day as a routine and a lax way of letting myself just enjoy myself. The truth is I really don’t get that much out of it anymore and it is just a routine.   I think about it when I am home. Never when I am at work. It is on my mind at home as something to start doing out of habit. I want to try to leave it behind.

539,You were sick but now you're well and there's work to do.,"Quote from Kilgore Trout in ""Timequake"" by Kurt Vonnegut.

The front room is where I have worked from home since March of 2020 as well as spent an entire school year homeschooling my kids while also being a drunk for most of that time. It was just disorganized as hell even still, so I spent the morning breaking down the folding tables we used for school desks and reorganizing everything and putting a lot of things away. And it just felt like I was clearing away and processing so much. The trauma of a year and a half of isolation, the trauma of alcoholism that worsened over that time period, the weird pride that we somehow still got through it, the depression and anxiety, and the sweet moments that still happened with my kids, just so so much. And I kept thinking about that line from Timequake. You were sick but now you're well, and there's work to do. It's true in so many ways. Another good one from pop culture - This house is clear.

540,Do I need to worry about severe withdrawals after one night of heavy drinking?,"Hello there,

So I went sober for about 3 weeks, but relapsed last saturday and drank heavily until the next morning. Slept throughout the day and felt tired through the monday as well.

Before that, I drank heavily for about 3 years, but on and off before that for almost a decade.

Now my question is: Should I expect heavy withdrawals after one night of drinking again? I usually got withdrawals 1-3 days after the last drink and am especially worried about delirium, although I never had it (just worried in general since I tend to have anxiety and psychotic symptoms with my depression). I have sever insomnia right now and know that this could be a sign of it, although I dont have any other severe withdrawal symptoms as of right now.

I want to stay sober this time and am ashamed that I relapsed after weeks of felling better.",t3_nzwsqw

I need to come up with a plan for something else to do when the witching hour hits.",t3_nzr671
543,Day 1 - 12 hours in - Owning this,"Real talk, this is hard, very hard. 

Stopping drinking, smoking and cannabis all at once today, cold turkey and realized the unbelievable amount of additional responsibility on top of cleaning up a bunch of small messes that should take a few thousand dollars and a week or so's worth of work/time. 

This would be the first time really in my adult life ALL of my sh\*ts together, as in super solid. Spent the better half of the last four years really getting everything on track and forging myself into the person I know I'm capable of being.

I've been very good the last few months I've been knee deep in taking care of spring cleaning, sorting through things (house and building more mental toughness), throwing out old things in my closet/house. Things that have hung on for the last 8 or so years that sort of felt like an albatross in my life preventing me climbing higher in my life.

Talking about things like debts, fixing my car, needing a few new clothes and other things I've neglected while drinking too much. 

But doesn't life love to throw curveballs at you right when you're running across the finish line? It's like someone was waiting with a baseball bat to make sure you're not going to cross it out of nowhere. 

This time I'm going to grab the bat and beat the shit out of that ""thing"" and walk across that finish line (I say this and maybe God might say ""don't get cocky, I have more shit to throw at you it hasn't even begin"", lol). 

My mom died last week, my best friend who was like a brother was like a drill sergent when giving life advice and it was horribly negative all the time doing to whole tear you down as a person all the time to ""make you tougher"" - that doesn't work well for me 24/7 and to boot he gave me a ton of shitty life advice from relationships to finance that I'd had to cut him out (knew him 15 years), and my former girlfriend is leaving to move back to her parents place in her home state after I split up with her (former friends shitty advice to do that, when I was vulnerable and doing the guys 'real talk', she was a solid solid person in my life too), changed my mind and still not going to work out it seems. 

To top it off my step-dad and little brother are leaving the state I live in too so effectively in the last two months the most close and important people that have been in my life are gone except a few. 

I really need this not drinking to stick, and honestly. I'm fucking terrified that life might throw even more shit my way that no amount of lifting weights, talk therapy or friends/social groups would help solve.

Seriously I'm absolutely terrified of God right now and what might be around the corner. What I can do is choose to keep my resolve.

Here's to day one and playing the tape forward to a sober day two tomorrow. We'll leave well enough for today as there is a lot of things to take care of.

547,Living life at an 8.,"Some people replied to my comment that I made and said it was good so I thought I’ll post it. 

Here it is,

Instead of being a 10 then going to a 1 constantly (10 being drunk and 1 being destroyed from being drunk), stay sober long enough to be at a 5 constantly. Then get enough sleep every night to be at a 6. Then start eating healthy to constantly be at a 7. Then get exercise consistently to be at a 7.5-8 constantly. 

Then let seeing family/friends you haven’t seen In forever put you at a 10. Let seeing a open body of water on a sunny day put you at a 10. Let a cup a coffee on a Saturday morning with the whole day ahead of you put you at a 9. 

We aren’t meant to live at 10. The highs of life come and go. When the highs come down, come back to an 7-8. Where you still feel fulfilled and thankful, and feel just good, not high but good. It’s way better than riding the chemical rollercoaster. Give it time, let your brain heal, take care of yourself. You can do this. IWNDWYT",t3_nz7465

549,Almost no one really cares whether you drink.,"I've figured something out regarding the social pressure to drink.  Almost no one REALLY cares whether you drink.  People just aren't that interested in you, by and large.  They're worried about what other people are thinking of them.

And if people do pressure you, screw it.  Nothing is more important than your health and peace of mind.

I admit that it's hard if someone close to you drinks.  I dated a guy who also had a serious problem with it, and I'm surprised we aren't dead given how much we enabled each other and normalized binge drinking for each other.  So that's a special case, being locked in (or thinking you are) with another drinker.  The truth is, you can walk, even from a parent or a child if they pressure you or enable you.  Some of us have to learn it the hard way.

I actually have the energy and desire to excercise and make healthy meals. 

I take little moments at random to just sit and appreciate the feeling of a clear mind and that even though my career and some areas of life are a bit up in the air I actually have the focus and drive to get shit done.

I'm still slacking sometimes, I dont rise every day at 5am and meditate and have green smoothies but I am making great steps to just push my future ahead in this new life style. 

I have no desire to drink alcohol. At all. I feel a great sense of freedom and pride and motivation to keep pushing forward but I do know I have to be vigilant and do the daily work required to ensure that I keep feeling this way.

I have unfollowed or muted any triggering accounts on social media and replaced them with people who are living a life that aligns with my values and goals - that has been a huge help

I am using visualisation to mentally prepare me for situations that may be triggering or just where I usually would have been drinking.

It's my first post here but I just wanted to share a thought I had recently and how it spurred me to have my longest sober streak in quite some time. I was listening to the book ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace. In the book she describes how drunk living isn't really living. It is more of a numb slog through life. I thought about this and became sad and regretful that I have let so many years of my life fall into this foggy landscape and that maybe I haven't really felt what it means to be alive in quite some time. I decided I didn't want to waste any more time to being numb and losing hours, days, weeks, months to black outs, hangovers and forgotten conversations. I want to feel everything for real...to remind myself why I love my family and friends, good food and telling stories, long walks with the doggies, hot showers and great music. I miss the real world and it's time to come back to it. I'm ready to fully experience the good and the bad and look back on my life and be sad that it's over, not sad because I missed it.",t3_nzgzqf
554,One whole year,"Hello everyone! I just want to share some things I've learned in the past year.


-The anxiety I thought was my normal was not. Heart pounding, crawling in my skin, terror almost constantly was all largely alcohol induced. If I could flip a switch and experience my state a year ago and come back to right now, I would weep with relief. 


-I am so much stronger than I ever gave myself credit for! I work in healthcare in a hard hit area. I definitely didn't feel strong at the time, or relief, or like I was taking control of anything. In fact it took ~6 months to feel sort of like I knew what I was doing or feeling more at peace with myself. But that blind leap is terrifying and anyone that does it cannot in any way be described as weak.


-I love potatoes. And normal poops. Real talk, I hadn't had a real solid bowel movement in a decade. Those first weeks were... Tough on my body. Squatty potty pose, it helps.


-Reading with sleepy time tea, cool room, heating pad, fresh laundry smell (they put it in a can you know, lol) and absolutely no visible clocks is my happy place. I was terrified of sleeping. That was my biggest drive to drink. For a while I thought it was my only one, surprise! It wasn't but that's a different post. Short meditations and then reading to my heart's content until I was sleepy. I love it. 


-Besides diving back into reading, I haven't accomplished much. I haven't started excersizing or picked up an old hobby or found a magical job I love or discovered a friend group or made a huge change in my life. So if you feel like you have to do that, I'm proof you can just keep doing you and that's enough. Being comfortable in my own skin is my big change. I haven't lost weight, but I'm so glad I have all these empty calories to fill, because as I've mentioned, I love potatoes. 


-All of the things I work on with my therapist actually help now. I've been in therapy off and on for years, mainly for anxiety, but artificially ramping up that terror every night made progress very difficult. Suddenly all the tools I've learned are much more effective. I'm much better at communicating, not letting people walk over me, realizing my reality matters, and being more in control of situations.

555,Today is the day,"I’ve said time and time again I’ll have my day one now. But this time I fully believe it. Last night I got so drunk I locked myself out of the house, stripped off naked and slept in the back of my car. I have humiliated myself so much the last 12 hours alone never mind throughout my 6 years of alcohol abuse. I hate myself so much for putting not only myself through this but my family too. I’m going to change and today is the day.

I’ve already booked an appointment with my GP to discuss my addiction and I’ve spoken to my sister, who dabbles in hypnotism, to try and guide me into sobriety through that. 

I just need help.",t3_nzjdvi
556,Sober Bar,"Doing some U.S. market research as I'm considering opening a sober bar in our city (there currently are none).

Sober bars seem to be a growing trend. They started in Europe, but they’re sweeping across the U.S. 

They come with all the perks of a “regular” bar — darts, karaoke, game nights, trivia, live bands — but without the booze. Depending on the bar, you’ll find milkshakes, sodas, mocktails, NA brew, kombucha, juice, or specialty drinks.

Is that something that would be of interest if it were in your market? Other suggestions you would like to see included?",t3_nz76ka
557,Thank You,"I posted on this subreddit 4 months ago, almost to the day. I was at what felt like rock bottom - drinking vodka in my closet while my wife was in the shower, skipping vet appointments for my pets so I could get drunk, lying to anyone + everyone about my alcohol consumption. I was puking almost nightly, and pretty perma-hungover. 

Today I am 122 days sober. The support and foundation that was given to me via this community gave me the push I needed. Thank you to everyone who shares here, everyone puts their vulnerabilities on display.

559,I want to stop drinking and smoking,"I’m pretty new to the sub but I’ve been on Reddit for quite some time. I’ve been struggling with alcohol and cigarettes for about 6-7ish years now and it all got worse during the pandemic that I was at some point drinking and “working” since I had the opportunity of WFH for a few months. I always feel so bad next day not just from being hungover but mentally and physically because I’ve been trying to lose weight, crazy thing is that last year I used to drink because I wasn’t making enough money to pay for basic needs and now I currently have a better paying job that I like but I still drink and smoke heavy on my days off. Because of my alcohol problem I’ve been through some situations where I could’ve gotten killed. I realize that for a couple of days and then I just forget about it and keep drinking. I would love to get some advice  because I’ve read some amazing stories in this sub that I truly would love to share mine in a couple of months saying “hi … this is my 4th or 5th month sober” that would be so amazing.

I have been struggling with sadness and loneliness this week. Being away from my family has put a lot of my life in perspective, and I've realized the things I thought I valued (being busy and grinding) are no longer serving me. I recently had a friend come over who brought alcohol into my space with my permission, but she then proceeded to leave half a pack of hard seltzers in my fridge. Tonight when I saw them in there, I thought, ""If I drank these, nobody would know."" 

So I did the only thing that made sense....I poured them down the drain and tossed the cans in the recycling.

So Saturday was the first time that I used a somewhat addictive, mind altering substance in a loooong time... and it was just meh. It was just relaxing, then I got a little funny, changed my perception momentarily, then coming down was a little depressing. Just meh. Just so not worth it somehow. Won't be doing that again any time soon. I'm just over it.

572,How to react to others repeating themselves while drinking,"I searched some keywords, but had trouble finding a similar post. I don't mind that others are drinking. And while it can be sad to see the change from sober into drunk, that's not my concern either. My biggest struggle so far is when they keep repeating themselves, I end up saying things like: ""I know."" ""You already said that."" Or just finishing the story/sentence for them because they've told me already... 

It's worse with my partner than friends, because my partner will go into specific details or stories that I've been hearing for years, not just repeated that specific night. Before, I'd be drunk too and either try to keep up or just zone out and think about other things while nodding along. 

I had a friend that was always a little mean when I was drunk and made me feel bad about repeating a story or information. I don't want to be that person who is rude and dismissive to my friends &amp; especially not to my partner! Maybe it just takes time/practice, but I was wondering about maybe specific verbal responses or other tips to help in this type of scenario.

573,Slipped after 6 days.,"So I drank after 6 days of sobriety. Whisky and beer. But I'm not going to beat myself over it. I'm doing much better than 2 months before, where I regularly drank to the excess. May was better, June is going great with only 2 drunk days out of 14.

I reminded myself that before drinking I took care of all of my responsibilities. I cooked, I cleaned, I washed the dishes and only after that did I start. 

Did not have a bad hangover (probably due to my less drinking), and had a little anxiety in the morning but I'm fine now. 

I just have to remind myself that slipping up is also part of the journey.

I worry that if I don’t have a beer, she will think I’m pregnant, and get judgy. (I just had a baby in January) I also don’t feel like telling her that I’m not drinking because I need to stop. 

My husband basically gave me the okay to drink while she’s here, “there’s a difference between having one or two, and getting hammered” 

I don’t want to break my streak, though! I saw her yesterday, outside at a restaurant where everyone was drinking. I was there to watch my 9 year old niece and her band perform a few songs. I was able to show up late/leave early. My infant daughter was hungry, so it was a good excuse to get outta there.

I actually like the taste of NA craft beers, or do I just think I like it to help me with the craving? Is there anybody that relate to those feelings?

Does that make any sense? I was trying to explain this to my husband, who, when I brought up the “meetings” thing, got worried that I was thinking about drinking again. I’m not, at all. But I want to stay “here,” and I think I’d like some like-minded people with similar experiences to chat with.

I contacted my GP today who basically said 'no room at the inn' - try these self-referral sites instead. Thank you for your help at least. Not to mention, I had two rejections from therapists saying that they're too busy to take on new clients, which I understand as well. I still have one introductory meeting with a counsellor tomorrow, so I'll see how that goes.

588,The first week.,"Hey everyone!

I’ve now been sober for one week.  Here are some observations I’ve had!

My energy levels fluctuate.  In the mornings and afternoon I have so much more energy.  In able to run further, faster, and feel great after doing it.  Granted I did just hurt my ankle by trying to do too much but that’s on me.  In the evenings I get sleepy and exhausted very fast.  I’m usually in bed no later than 9:30 and sleeping before long.

I haven’t had any bad side effects.  If you remember my original post, I did not quit cold Turkey at the start.  I tapered down for weeks to ease myself into it.  Because of that, I think, I haven’t had any bad experiences.  I have not had any shakes,  no hallucinations, and no swings in my blood pressure

My weight has fluctuated heavily.  In the first four days I swung down around twelve pounds.  In the days that have followed ice swung back five pounds.  I haven’t gained any inches on my waist though so I think my scale may be busted.

I have not had the desire to drink again and IWNDWYT.",t3_nzkcun
589,Update after 3rd DUI and 1 year SOBRIETY,"Im going to paste the link to my original post . I believe i made two posts.

This will also likely be my last post in regards to this. I just want to share a little for people who are either feeling the need to relapse or for the newcomers coming in.

Today i feel much much better. Although the PTSD itself is truly a difficult life task and effects me everyday, i have been able to come to terms with the condition compared to trying to fight it. Thats due to sobriety. So how has the year been? well i am driving with an interlock device installed. This has helped me tremendously and i actually like the device. If i go out or socialize it really cuts all the edge off for me. I cant start my vehicle if i drink so i dont even think about it. I really like it. 

Ive spent a lot of the year working on emotional therapy. I have spent time reflecting on what gets me going and Where i feel those emotions in my body and how to cope with them. Ive realized that i do need to step back and take time to myself in order for me to get balanced. If i dont i am useless and worked up. If i dont get selfish and take the time to cool down and dial back emotionally, i will be a disaster until i do. its something ive focused heavily on lately and it really works. 

I have a sponsor and do zoom meetings. Still not a huge fan of the AA program, however, being around addicts is nice and it keep me accountable for my actions. This reminds me im an alcoholic. Its like taking my medication.

I started exercising, meditating, and eating clean to get me on track and not have to take my prescribed medication. Ill be honest, taking the medication prescribed is what really started working. so take your meds lol.. I was stubborn as i am totally against big pharma, but once i committed i really started seeing improvements. 

I think over the year ive really learnt these key things:

1- slow down.

2- dont give a fuck what people think

3- take the time to work on yourself

4- do what you want to do

5- dont take this life seriously

590,I just wanted to share,"This is my first post here, but I am a long-time lurker. I just wanted to share with a community that will truly understand - I’m currently attending a spin class that is every Sunday morning at 8:30 AM. A year ago, I wouldn’t have been able to get out of bed before noon because of my hangover. Every Sunday I get up, go to the class, have a nice and relaxing day afterward, and usually fit in a nap, cleaning, etc. For some people this may not seem like a big deal, but making that time for self care and being able to do things for myself because I’m not hungover makes me really understand how far I’ve come. If you’re lurking, it really is worth it in the end.

591,The day I’ve been dreaming about. One year alcohol free.,"Warning: this is a long post. I am mostly making this for myself because imagining making this post has gotten me through a few difficult moments this year.

                            ——-

Around this time of day one year ago today, I opened my last drink. It was a bottle of corona left over from my 30th birthday party the night before, where I drank many many beergaritas and (like always) eventually blacked out. The night itself was actually very fun, unlike so many other nights that I got blackout drunk. But a few months earlier I had made a promise to myself, after I received what I now think of as a sign from a higher power.

Around the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was ordered to stay at home and only walks were allowed, I became (like many other people) very obsessed with Fiona Apple’s latest album. One day I was going for my daily stroll and after listening to the album on repeat for a week, I was devouring all the podcasts about it that I could find. I downloaded a bunch of episodes without looking at any of them too hard. One of these podcasts turned out to be Recovery Happy Hour (to this day my favourite recovery podcast). I had always known that one day I would have to quit drinking, and listening to this podcast, combined with the upheaval of the pandemic and the thought of my encroaching 30th birthday, it seemed like it was finally the right time. 

(I’m gonna interject here for a second to say that it’s probably best to seek professional help if you were drinking the amount that I was, and I would have done so if I knew then what I know now)

Anyway, so I opened that last bottle to calm the shakes, and something about it just felt different. I’m proud to say I poured my last drink out halfway. 

It hasn’t been an easy year for anyone, and I am no exception. Shortly after getting sober I suffered a seizure that left me with a head injury. Dealing with the various complications has been the biggest test of my sobriety this year, rivalled only by the difficulty of finally confronting all the pain I was drowning out for so many years. But to anyone who is still thinking about it, I will echo the thousands of others and say DO IT. It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself. And though it may be hard at times, it is often much easier than you could imagine.

So on this day I say thank you from the bottom of my heart to SD, to the people at the meetings, and to all the loved ones who supported me by buying me non alcoholic gin for my birthday yesterday. Only one thing left to say:

592,Back after a long relapse,"Hi- I’m new here. Just coming back to sobriety. Had 23 years, went out for 7 years and now have 4 days sober. I’m doing all I can to reclaim a sober life. It’s hard. I find this forum very helpful.",t3_nz72m1

594,New to sobriety,"Day 4 is winding down. It's weird, because I almost feel hungover. Bouts of hot and cold, headache, nausea, irritability, brain fog, fatigued, but also stir crazy. I'm also ravenous. I feel like no amount of food or sparkling water is making me feel full. I guess it's because I would binge drink at least once/twice a week, and have a few drinks most other nights, unless I was too hungover to stomach it. I'm so tired, but I also feel very alert. 

This is a very strange experience. I'm trying to just be patient with my body while it deals with not having large amounts of alcohol poured into it after taking that abuse the past nearly three years. I've been going back and forth from reading this sub to finding funny things to distract me to listening to the audiobook for Alcohol Explained, and between all of it I'm eating every couple of hours because my stomach will start growling at me in protest. 

On another note, I told two friends and my father that I've been setting intentions the past 4 days to not drink, just so they know what's going on. My husband is being patient with the funk I'm in. I can tell he's proud of me but doesn't want to spook me by making a fuss. He deserves a sober me, and so do I. 

The past two days I've been more honest about my drinking with myself and this sub than I've ever been. I'm trying to shrug off that heavy cloak of shame I've been wearing so I can have more sober days ahead of me. 

Gonna go eat more food. Peace, love, and IWNDWYT.",t3_nze7de
595,I have doubled my previous (and only noteworthy) sobriety record.,"Today marks 8 weeks of stone,cold, bitter, hard, joyous, depressing, exciting, emotions so out of whack I wanna vomit sobriety. Holy shit the dust hasn’t settled yet. I started this journey really expecting 2 weeks of drying out then life would be better. The clearing house would show up at my door with my check, I’d grow 3 inches taller, my relationships would improve overnight, I’d have a 6 pack (abs of course), and a new wardrobe. I really expected all of that (in one form or another). Nope. Im mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually exhausted. My poor wife has had to deal with my INSANE mood swings. It feels like the high highs and the low lows have been sitting in the back of my head, waiting to come out when/if I ever got sober. Like when someone kinks a water hose then let’s it go. It’s real fast and violent at first. Well I’m here, not drinking, trying to figure out how to get past the “at first” part of that water hose being unkinked. 
I have started working through a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook as well as reading a book on it. I’m seeing some patterns and a lot of things that make sense. I’ll report back on that in 7 weeks when I finish this first workbook. BUT….. I am 8 weeks sober. I am working on myself in a way I never have. Doing things I should have been doing for my mental well-being a decade ago. No 6 pack yet but my face isn’t as fat, so that’s nice. No check from publishers clearing house but I have managed to sink more money in investments lately. To anyone on the fence, I highly recommend sobriety. It’s absolutely a better way to live. You’ll actually be living. 

You guys/gals are great. I tried to explain this sub to my mom earlier this week when she asked if I was in a support group. She looked at me like I was crazy but that’s ok. I love her anyway.

597,Praise for the non-SSRI antidepressant Wellbutrin and it's effect on my alcohol consumption.,"Heyo. I'm a scandinavian M 31, have been struggling with periods excess beer/vodka/whiskey-binging for many years of my life, and I often find myself looking forward to said binges. But no more.

**TL;DR: Wellbutrin is an NDRI antidepressant which can help with weight loss, increased energy, focus, initiative and sex drive, and reducing alcohol and nicotine cravings. It has side-effects which vary from person to person. Read up and check out!**

I wanted to inform you guys of the success I've had with Wellbutrin. All anecdotal, of course. It's an antidepressant, a mild stimulant, and an NDRI (norepidephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor) in contrast to SSRI (seretonin reuptake inhibitor). I've been taking SSRIs for many years of my life with little to no positive effect. I researched Wellbutrin a bunch before asking my doc for a prescription, and many people reported increased energy and intitiative, increased sex drive, but also insomnia. Most SSRIs can cause weight gain, but Wellbutrin does the opposite as it is reported to suppress appetite and gives you energy. It also supposedly can help cull intrusive/negative thoughts.

I started taking Wellbutrin (150mg extended release) a week ago, and my cravings for alcohol, nicotine and shitty foods is gone. I wake up well rested, take my pill (around 7-8 AM) and feel like a focused powerhouse after 30 min and throughout the day, tapering off towards the evening. I don't crave laxing in the couch eating bacon, eggs and toast in the morning after waking up, rather I crave going for a jog, a bike ride, work on projects, fix stuff around the house etc, doing productive stuff. I have great focus, and I feel a lot happier and positive than I have ever done. I tried drinking a beer while watching a movie with my GF this saturday night, and it just felt off. It didn't taste particularly good, no craving for chugging it like I ususally do, I didn't even finish it and it just made me feel sleepy.

There are side effects reported, and they can vary wildly from person to person as I've learned through watching/reading multiple youtube videos/reddit threads, the biggest one perhaps being insomnia. For me though, it has been the opposite. Around 22/23 PM I'm as sleepy as a really sleepy baby, and I sleep deep and well.

If I remember correctly, it could be a bit hard on the liver, so I suggest you do a detox period (NAC, milk thistle, ALA) for some time before starting the meds.

So yeah, please do you own research and consult your doc, but this shit has worked wonders for me :) Hope you all are doing okay &lt;3 Wish you the best.

598,"Thinking about relapsing, knowing I can’t, sucks.","Major tw on this one- Sorry to vent but I have nowhere else to put this and unfortunately Reddit has become the only place I feel any kind of solace. Today was hard. Every day for the last few years has been hard. I’m an alcoholic, drug addict, self harmer, with an eating disorder and major trauma. I’m 24 and I’ve been sober for about 1 year and 9 months from all mind altering substances but I’m addicted to diet pills and actively starving myself and self harming. I am so under-stimulated and disappointed with the world around me that all I want is to drink and escape it. But, I won’t, because I’m afraid I’ll black out and either kill myself or GET killed (I’ve been in some fucked up scary situations), or cheat on my boyfriend, or drain my bank account. So today, by a thin margin, I will not drink.",t3_nz7qz6
599,Wake up call,"(36 F) First of all, I have to admit that I knew I had a problem with my drinking. When I opened one it always ended with 6-7 or more. On weekday, on weekend, almost everyday after work and even at 9AM. I even went to external therapy (2nd one) because of COVID and it helped me a lot. I still have my journal and my calendar where I write down my alcohol consumption. I went 66 days sober and then I relapsed during the Holidays. Since then, I was still trying to convince my self that I wasn’t an alcoholic and that I was just drinking a little more than a « normal » person. 
I have health problem (as far as I know not related to alcohol) and I had to run blood test. Because I knew I had my blood test on a Friday, I stopped drinking on a Sunday. And I know I’m right because, as I said I, I still have my calendar. 
The week after, my doctor’s nurse called me saying that I have to do it all again because one marker was too high. She really really insisted on the fact that I can’t have a drink 24h to 48h prior my blood test and even write it down on the request that I received by mail. At that time, I’m confused because I knew I was 5 days sober. 

Then it hit me like a train: I’m an alcoholic and it shows in my blood. 

Since THE call (11 days ago), I’m sober and even attended 3 AA meetings. My health is now my priority. Every day I struggle with anxiety but it’s improving slowly. One 24 hours at a time! My next step is to do another blood test and see if the marker is still high. Even if it is, I’m done with drinking! It’s been 6 years of drinking almost everyday just to not feel anything at all. 

Sorry for my English, French is my first language.",t3_nzc6m9
600,An apology,"Hello everyone. 

Last week I made a post about my personal experience with moderation. I made that post because I was excited to share what felt good at the moment. The post was removed due to it being possibly triggering for folks who are sober and have more severe/dangerous relationships with alcohol. Though the post was within the subs rules, I understand that this sub is a support group, and that post wasn't contributing or supporting anyone. 

I just wanted to apologize to anyone who may have been made uncomfortable, and thank the mod who clearly but not condescendingly explained why that post was not OK. 

I in no way meant to detract from the content or nature of this sub, and I deeply appreciate how powerful and positive this community is. 

I'm sorry for my insensitivity to the matter at the time. Yall are great. Have a wonderful day.


Edit: if any readers of the sub are like me and are wanting to cut back, or any of you who would like to discuss that, I'm totally open to PM discussions. I've been having a blast coming up with cool mocktails over the last couple weeks anyway, and sharing recipes is fun =)",t3_nz5k84
601,I felt the craving and let it go,"It was like a bubble of tension in my chest that threatened to ruin my sunday afternoon. At first I didnt recognise it for what it was. Irritability, I thought. Discomfort. A drink would probably make it feel better.

Yeah, it would. Because it was a craving. I saw it then, that this was something only drinkers (and smokers in my case) feel. This was tension caused by alcohol, and while alcohol would balm it for now, it wouldn't solve anything. It would perpetuate the problem. I saw it for myself!

And once I saw it for what it was, I let it go. I breathed, and the tension relaxed a little. I focused on how even though I didnt know why I was tense, I knew alcohol would solve it. I knew that was the key, that if I could reframe it as alcohol was making me tense, I wouldn't even be tempted to give in. I reminded myself that I could live free from this tension forever, if I wanted to. I breathed again. 

And the tension faded. My sunday was saved! And it was lovely, relaxing and rejuvenating. 

So to anyone feeling that nagging tension, my advice: breathe. Wonder why you know alcohol would fix the tension. Is it maybe because you deep down know it is the cause? Remember you can be free of it, all you have to do is choose freedom.

I AM making progress but I have failed time and again. I feel positive about the progress, but I keep going back to it. I’m tired of failing. I’m tired of drinking. I’m beyond over hangovers.

604,230 Days Down the Drain,"This is a hard one to write.

Today I must reset my date back to day one. I am very upset about this. The times that I have been tempted to start drinking again, it is this sub that has stopped me. It may sound silly, but I was proud of my growing number and didn't want to start over. That is what would stop me. A number. 

Not yesterday it didn't.

My husband and I are at a resort, Vegas style, and I guess what usually goes with that is drinking.

Part of the problem is that my husband is a drinker. I tried not to let that deter me along the way. I even used it as a motivator at times. However it is hard, and can be lonely, to be a non drinker and have a partner who drinks.

So Day One it is again. Fxxx. I'm really upset. I'm really mad at myself. And if I'm really honest, I also blame my husband.",t3_nz9f3m
605,So I guess I should tell the story. Hi by the way.,"Drinking started after I graduated college. Pretty atypical. Started off innocent enough and just a six pack every couple weeks or so. 

Turned into liquor just to see how drunk I could get. Plus it was cheaper. $20 for a few drunk nights, or $10 for Everytime I wanted to drink. Made sense. 

Went from Friday, to Friday Saturday Sunday, to Friday Saturday Sunday, and Wednesday too, to every day. 

I'm the years I've ran potential girlfriends off. Texting them crazy things at 2am, being drunk Everytime we hung out. It would be one or two dates max. 

Really thought it was a phase, that I was just being ridiculous and getting it all out. 

Fast forward to now. I hardly know how much I even drink. It's basically any day my body can handle it. If I'm not puking the second I smell alcohol, I'm drinking myself to sleep that night. 

Today, I've been insanely bored. Hit a really hard and scary depressive state basically all day. I both want someone to talk to and want everyone to leave me alone. I both want to try and drink, and just genuinely don't have the energy for it. I just feel like I'm in limbo, just floating. Not in a good way though. I just feel lost. What do I even like anymore? I hope that makes sense. 

Was scrolling reddit and saw this place. Thought I might kinda tell the story. I'm so bored, don't really have anything else to do.",t3_nzbb3j

608,Advice for managing peer pressure to drink at after hours work events?,"I have a work trip that is going to involve a lot of party time, and it’s the first time I’m meeting all of my coworkers in person.

My reaction to people pursuing the topic of why I am sober has not been great. I have gotten sullen about being asked and I really don’t want to get in that kind of mood with my coworkers. I once had a very trusted mentor say something really thoughtless in front of other senior people. I felt so on the spot and like this had direct relevance to my job. It didn’t seem fair. 

Anyone have any serenity now hacks for these kinds of events? Lol.",t3_nzfjn2
609,I slipped.,"Back to day one. I don't know how to do this. I didn't drink today solely because my husband was home all day, constantly thinking maybe I'll drink tomorrow, when can I sneak it next, etc. It was our one year wedding anniversary today, and I was willing to ruin that to drink (if I could've gotten away with it).

I need to find the motivation and desire to quit again. I don't want to wait for the next horrible thing to happen to motivate me to stop again. 

I've been reading all the quit lit books, I understand the theories, but I can't stop entertaining the idea of still drinking. 

I see all these high numbers on here and I just don't get how it's possible.

611,Question for diabetics or prediabetics,"I’m not sure if this is the right forum to post, so if not, please disregard or notify me and I will delete.  

Anyway, I’ve been prediabetic for many years and managed to stay off the meds.  I had not crossed the threshold to diabetes.  The last couple of days, my morning glucose is close to diabetic level.  My theory is that my pancreas and liver have been so busy processing the alcohol that it didn’t get to the food with sugar and carbs.  It’s been 2 weeks since I quit and my glucose is elevated.  

My question is, if anyone is diabetic or prediabetic, have you noticed an increase in your glucose levels since you quit drinking?",t3_nzl5lv

Drinking is creeping into the areas of my life and I hate it. I don’t know what to do, I’m tired of myself.I don’t wha to disappoint the people close to me.

Then I remembered I have no moderation. I've never been someone who can do anything moderately. I either do nothing or give something 110% and alcohol was no different. One drink would turn into getting trashed. I'd probably do something I regret or say something fucking dumb. Sure it would be fun in the moment but the moment I woke up the next morning the hangover would hit me.

I don't want to drink. I'm nostalgic about a feeling that has long since passed.

615,I don't want to go back,"Well, I've been no drinking for 22 months and a week ago made a mistake (my brain made a ""valuable"" reasoning for that at the moment) and I liked the buzz I got from 0.5L of beer.

I understand that I don't want to return to my previous habit, but damn, if my will power can lack like that and I got some kind of joy from drinking, that can be potentially harmful in the future if my brain will make more excuse when I'll feel down.

I wanted to spill it out because I feel down after that, like I don't control my life. And my friends still tend to be peer pressuring me even after almost 2 years and I don't want to share that I failed because they most likely won't be supportive.

616,Things I wish I knew about drinking earlier in life,"I often see posts here about those in their 30s experiencing major hardships, particularly in terms of physical health. I really wish someone had explained to me the damage a body takes from alcohol after you hit 30. I'm 34, approaching 35 this summer, and had a ""mini-stroke"" that left part of my body paralyzed for a couple months. 

In my head I thought ""Well I'm too young for that! It can't be!"" As a reference, my own alcoholic father who drank wayyy more than I ever could would throw down a couple bottles of vodka per day. I was ""only having"" a bottle of wine per night.

I had no way to explain this stroke to my bosses without outing myself as an alcoholic, so I found a way to quit the job. It was a job I actually liked, and I felt so ashamed of myself for squandering that opportunity (among many others due to drinking), and just always assumed this was something I would have to avoid later in my 40s or 50s.

Everyone's biochemistry is different. Having that stroke woke me up enough to start attending meetings and seeing a doctor.

I urge anyone in their 20s or 30s to know that really bad things can happen from alcohol even while your body is still relatively young and healthy. I didn't receive this information soon enough but am now taking it to heart and making some progress, and I hope the same for others. Thanks",t3_nyv0u2
617,Accidentally took a drink,I will keep it short but looking for advice. I took the girlfriend out for a date this evening and we stopped at an upscale restaurant. I’ve been sober for over a month now and made a promise to myself that the last drink I would take would be in my twenties. So far so good. I wasn’t paying attention when she ordered a blueberry lemonade (or else I would have realized it was alcoholic). I saw it looked good and took a sip and immediately noticed the taste. Feeling very disappointed that I technically have now taken a drink of alcohol in my thirties even unintentionally. Also terrified that this will pop back up as a factor in drinking again. It may sound silly but I’m beating myself up right now mentally.,t3_nzc98k
618,One year :),It’s been a better year in every way. I’m really grateful to this subreddit because I’m too shy to go to AA meetings but I know I always have a place here to connect and share. Thank you :),t3_nz0g6q
619,Facial Bloat,"Over the past few years my drinking escalated dramatically. As of recently I am noticing more and more just how bloated and flushed my face always is. It's uncomfortable and embarrassing. One of the many reasons I am going to attempt quitting is due to the negative implications on my body. I feel like it is rotting from the inside out. Not to mention the mental/emotional setbacks as well.

How long did it take for you to notice facial bloat subsiding? I'm sure staying hydrated will speed up the process, but looking forward to the bloat going away 🤞",t3_nzg391
620,"OK, let's give this a go...","Started drinking too much 8 years ago when I was working in the restaurant industry. It was part of the culture, the late nights. I kept the habit up: a few drinks a night, often more, sometimes MUCH more, skip a night here or there. Relationship and career has been going great, so of course it's been easy to lie to myself: ""It's just a few before bed,"" ""It's not every night."" ""It's a habit, not a problem"" ""Some people are WAY worse"" etc etc. All the while ignoring the fact that I haven't gone more than 3 days totally sober in nearly a decade. 

Things have been going off the rails this past year since I've been working from home. Less structure to my days. More anxiety and just sheer boredom. My partner doesn't know ANY of this. I'm accountable only to myself. ""Just a few"" isn't so few anymore. The ""nights off"" have been further between. I'm hiding bottles. I'm risking worse weekday hangovers since I don't have to be in the office. When I do take a night off, the next day I feel amazing. I'm positive and productive and then I say to myself ""I should celebrate with a drink!"" 

There hasn't been a rock bottom. Just a series of cascading lows. Carving away at myself bit by bit. I'm unhappy and unhealthy. I don't like hiding from my partner, feeling like I'm living a double life. This is too much for me to reveal to her, at least for now. I'm trying to get back into therapy (therapists are hugely in demand right now TURNS OUT!) I understand I'm not going to be able to make any lasting change completely on my own.

This isn't going to be easy. More and more my few hours drinking is all I look forward to in the day. And I've let myself down countless times with false starts. But I can't let that be self-perpetuating. Me posting is at least something new. This is actually the first time I'm putting all of this out there somewhere other than my own head.

So...tonight, I won't drink. And go from there.",t3_nz9oqe
621,Allergic Reactions,"I quit drinking for a number of reasons but one major reason was my physical reaction to alcohol. It started out with certain brands, or mostly ciders, but turned to beer, wine, liquor, all of it. And, what started as a couple times a year turned into almost every time that I drank (a few times a week).

Hyper-sensitization from my understanding. 
My mother is 30 years sober and still active in her recovery, and my sister gets a similar reaction, though much less severe. I wonder if it's genetic. 

Reaction includes red/purple cheeks and hands and knee areas, hot cheeks, awful asthma and extreme exhaustion. It's debilitating and my body is making it pretty clear that it's in distress.  Usually lasts a few hours. 

On the days I think maybe I could have a drink or two, I remind myself, I am quite literally allergic to alcohol.

6 months into my sobriety and this sub and I've just thought to ask, has anyone else experienced this or know more about it?

Side note, my doctor used to say, it sounds like maybe you should stop drinking? And I'd say yeah, and silently laugh at the thought like it wasn't even a possibility. But, here we are. And in hindsight, duh?",t3_nzf3m7

624,Had a drink: proved to myself I’m sober for good,"I had to go to an employee BBQ with my boss and his boss there. Without going into too much detail, the company is based in a country with a HUGE drinking culture and a huge hierarchy culture. In other words, those “above” you in rank have the authority to get you as drunk as they want. 

I was able to expertly avoid most drink offers until my boss’s boss poured me some champagne. It would’ve looked SO bad to refuse in front of my coworkers, so I finished the small glass. I was terrified that I would love the taste (bubbly was one of my vices in the past) and that it’d drive me to drink way more but... it didn’t!!

I didn’t like the taste. The ever so slight buzz didn’t feel good nor did it enhance my enjoyment of the BBQ in any way. Maybe some would consider the small drink I had to be a break in my sobriety streak, but for me it was the opposite. It ended up reaffirming how much I love sobriety and how much I don’t want to drink, without relapse. I enjoyed the rest of the party sipping on seltzer instead. 

I’ve come up with a new method so I don’t even have to accept that small glass at future BBQ’s: just going to say I can’t on the medication I’m on. 

I’m almost at nine months sober and feel ever stronger than before in my resolve after this dumb BBQ incident. Thanks for listening :)",t3_nz3ru8

I go to a very party heavy school, and a stacked ufc card made going to Riley’s almost a must. 

Yesterday, the 12th, I managed to stay sober through through the bars.
I meet a girl and we vibe, so we decide to leave. 

We get back to my house and she instantly goes for the bottle of brunettes in my freezer (roomates), and proceeds to drink more, to the point where she is close to borderline hammered. 

I am not one to advantage of any type of girl, and I should have drove her home right there. Instead, the devil on my shoulder got the best of me, and I decided to pound the rest of the bottle to get to her level.

I get absolutely plastered, and using context clues you could probably guess the end of the story.

I drove her home in the morning, she got a kiss goodbye, and we went our separate ways.

I get back home and the post drink guilt starts to hit me. Immediately break down and call my Mom and Jiddo to let them know about the relapse.

We all make fuck ups, the key is learning from them, and not making the same one twice. (As cliche as it sounds)

Last night my brother and I had a little movie marathon and before beginning I said, ""theres some beer downstairs if you want"". He replied, ""Oh cool, if you're gonna go grab one can you get me one as well?"" I paused for a moment and thought, \*I don't need alcohol to enjoy this movie\*, then spoke, ""I don't want any but you go ahead"". Just reminding myself that I have the ability to say no was a really powerful feeling. I think if I were to continue enjoying alcohol I'd need to get into the pattern of saying no first.",t3_nz7g82
631,My struggle,"I'm sure most of what I say will be familiar to some and the rest, maybe it's just how I look at it but, I feel like no one understands.

 Little vague background. 

I was raised to by my mom who thankfully quit drinking when I was very young. However, looking back she went from abusing us and alcohol and drugs to ""taking her prescriptions"". It wasn't until I was 26 that I realized she imbelished the truth to get whatever she wanted, including percocets, morphine, uppers, downers. I'd love to believe she did the best she could raising my brothers and I. Anyway.... as her ""baby"" she raised me to ""never leave her"" if that makes sense. 

I struggle with purpose.  I've reached a level in my work that I didn't think I'd ever achieve... ever.  I reached it at such a young age that I get funny looks when people meet me. The people who work for me are on average 10 years older than me. I've reached this position while drinking too much but really like 3 to 4 times a week for 13 years.  Since reaching this level my drinking had gotten worse and I have nothing to look to as goals. I truly don't know what to do.  

I have a wife and kids,  they are amazing and everyone I know thinks I'm a good parent.  Truly.  My life is work and my kids and my kids/family are #1. I guess that's my problem though is I have no real goals. Before it was to be ""happy"" and that came with money which gives freedom. 

I need a new goal.  I'm introverted and in a job that requires me to be extroverted so when I'm done with work I'm just done. I've recently started working out more consistently but can't shake the feeling that I'm a constant failure. I know I could do so much more, be something truly great,  I feel deep down like I either don't deserve it or ""I don't want to do better"". 

I'm truly lost at this.  I haven't quit drinking but I'm slowing down and I know if I have a goal outside of work, family, and alcohol I could truly make progress.  

I look forward to anyone's suggestions.

632,I did it.,"I went for a pool afternoon and dinner with a few friends yesterday. I didn’t drink.

I drank sparkling water, tap water, I ate a good meal, dessert and that was it.

I didn’t drink.

I’m proud of myself.

I’m quite sure I would’ve felt better if I had drank, it only for that temporary moment of euphoria... but I know it wouldn’t have lasted.

I’m grieving the loss of someone and I’m deeply convinced that if I had had alcohol, I would’ve been even sadder about them or might even have broken no contact - only to regret it the next morning.

It was my first social activity since the loss of that person and since I’ve stopped drinking.

I don’t regret going, but I’m still filled with loneliness as I’m back to the void that is my normal life.

But I went; and I stayed fully sober.

I just needed to tell someone.",t3_nz1wbh
633,Six days - some observations,"For me..
- the cravings are less physical than psychological and habitual 
- I’ve been around alcohol the temptation has been nominal
- I do THINK about drinking a lot more than I realized 
- the boredom I heard others reference is real. 
- having some THC helped. 
- this forum has been really valuable in helping me to reflect on my relationship with alcohol.

634,Craving came back today,"Closing I on one month sober, and generally very happy with myself and how great I feel.  I had been thinking I didn’t even miss it anymore, seemed so easy.  Today had to come back to this thread to remind me how fucking evil alcohol is to me.  Iwndwyt",t3_nzdxlt
635,I know how it ends,"I posted last week that my father was found dead in a motel. He died from alcohol use disorder and alcohol induced liver disease. He left my brother and I with a mess to pick up. Even at the end when he was apparently sick he didn’t believe he would die. He left no will, he left nothing to help my brother and I. Just pieces to pick up; a complete mess. Wednesday I  went to a county morgue and picked his belongings up in a plastic evidence bag. I then found myself at the motel he died at, collecting the rest of his personal items. 
I had to go through his belongings, which all reeked of death and sickness. 

After all of this, a friend texted my spouse, jokingly telling them that he has been on a bender all week. Certainly he was being beyond tone deaf considering the situation but he was drunk, so his inhibitions were down. 

All I could think in response to that was “I know how it ends”. I just spent 5 days picking up the pieces of a 7 year bender. I was going through old pictures of my father from when he was our age. He was so full of life, healthy, young, but he flushed it all down the drain because of alcohol. We never think it will be us until it is us. And even then, he never realized that he was going to die. 

So for some reason 40 something days after I decided to get sober I found myself in this situation. In the moment it was the worst thing I could ever feel or know.
But now I believe it is a gift. Because regardless of where you start or where you might think you are, I now know how it ends. 

Thank you for reading. I’m still sober and will remain for the rest of my life. Before this I had an idea of maybe trying to moderate again but that will never happen. IWDWYT",t3_nyxegu
636,A tip for summer,"As the hot weather rolls in, all of us are going to he hit with that euphoric recall. Funny how we remember that tiny moment, of a cold beer on a hot day. But our brains neglects to fill in the rest of the story.

This is my 12th summer dry. Its still a weird time of the year for me. I was in squalor when I was drinking hot summer days, paralysed in chasing that one moment of clarity booze brought. I just wanted that one moment where it all made sense.

Never could get it. The longer we drink the more flitting that moment become.

Bottom line for most of us summer is hard.

I started to do something that really helped me some years ago. It may sound too simple but maybe it could help you.

I started to chill all of my drinks super super chill them.
Mostly water actually. Water has helped stay sober for 12 years. Chilling it looking forward to it, its like drinking gratitude that I'm not putting a fucking vodka down my throat. 

It feels clean, good and the water reminds me of my commitment to my sobriety.

It feels good to take responsibility for my choices.

It's always a bit weird seeing my friends drink. And I recognise there's a part of me that just wants to have fun. But it's not fun is it, it's a quick slide down into misery.

641,Day 1,"I'm bored.

I recently started a job that's taken me overseas for the better part of a year. I'm living out of a hotel room and working shifts 2 days on 2 days off. The city I'm in is currently in full lock down. About 2 months into this routine.

This has turned out to be the perfect storm that's pushed me over the edge.  Back home I had enough responsibility to keep my mind moving, normal workweek, family dinners, kids outings, bike rides etc. I've always drank too much when I start, but other responsibilities have kept me from starting.

My on days are pretty full so I tend to work, eat sleep... Maybe a Netflix in there somewhere.

My off days have turned into a reoccurring disappointment in myself. 

Wake at 0400 (doesn't matter what the night before was like, its hard wired, no alarm) coffee, water, Motrin. Check email for a side gig I have going on. Shave and ride into the gym.  I get at least an hour of lifting, cardio, HIIT in then ride home. 

Shower

Dishes, laundry, call the family (adulting, right?)

Watch some tv, play a video game, getting bored. Listen to audio book (just started the naked mind).

It's maybe 10AM. 

Look around see the bottle of wine or whiskey, ""What the hell? Nothing better to do"" 

After killing the wine or several glasses of Jack I'm zonked on the couch with some nonsense show. 

Sleep, nap, pass out. It's mid-afternoon. 

At this point I either give up entirely and drink some more or start beating myself up for wasting my day.

Cook some dinner (or order junk food) waste some more time and go to sleep by 8pm (have to get those eight hours right?) 

Wake up at 1AM, sweating and hung over chug some water take a Motrin, try to sleep again.

Repeat for day two. 

I've got fat again, I'm always tired. 

1. I will not drink with you today. 
2. I will find a way to use my off days to make myself better vice slowly killing myself with poison.
3. Find a hobby that I can do out of hotel room.",t3_nzefnm
642,The mighty hill is on the horizon...,"Last night I put down the bottle and questioned myself, truly as to why I was drinking. Back in May I did pretty good....sort of. Lasted a week and made the mistake of ""it's the weekend! reward yourself! you can control it!""

Nope. 

But I was very flippant about it. No big deal. Except yeah it is. Running is my entire life, and because of alcohol it has taken a drastic toll. My motivation has dropped significantly, I lay in bed all day on my weekends doing jack because of my hangover headache. 

I know why I drink. But I cannot remove myself from the immediate source (I don't want to get into it). 

Well. Today I slammed my foot down and had a pep talk. About how I better put the poison down before I go back home to see my family again (two weeks, not long enough). And by god I was ready to do it, and I was going to get back into my running because I've always been a runner first damn it!

Caught an old friend out smoking and decided there was no harm in chatting him up. I will state that I am military, Army specifically. This is important to know for the rest of the context of this post.

Back to old friend. He spilled to me some shitty news about how our *very out of touch* leadership is making changes to the unit that I vehemently dislike. **VEHEMENTLY**. We took a walk and talked about these changes, as we were walking some assholes decided to make it a point to call me a man (I am a woman, I very much identify as such, I just prefer short hair) for no reason other than to be hurtful and cruel. Then some more shit news sent me spiraling (again pertaining to my shit unit) and before I knew it I was in my car speeding to the nearest gas station and picking up 100 proof vodka while screaming internally to not do it. 

I know suddenly weening yourself off of alcohol can have spikes of anxiety so I caved because my anxiety skyrocketed from the shit hole base I am in and how leadership likes to play fun games with how miserable they can make their soldiers (specifically lower enlisted) here. 

**BUT BUT BUT i** ENDED UP ANGRILY POURING THE BOTTLE OUT AND TELLING MYSELF I HAD ENOUGH!!!!!!

I'm going to do this but it's hard. Army culture has a strong tendency to almost *glorify* the fact that its service members are high functioning alcoholics. Hell, someone I work with constantly brags about this fact. It's like a medal of honor and it's pretty scary. 

No one knows that I struggle like this and my pride will not allow me to seek out programs that can help me get through this. My unit is full of toxic people in leadership roles who I know for a stone cold fact would turn this against me.

But I  know I am not in it completely alone. Because this subreddit, that I lurked in for such a long time is here and I am going to let it be know here and now as a testimony: 

Enough is enough.

Day 1 starts now. Wish me luck and see you on the flip side!",t3_nzefe5

644,Good For Thought,"I just wanted to share a little insight I’ve come across in my journey to sobriety that might be helpful to others. We all know that alcohol has a significant negative impact on our mental, physical and emotional health, but many do not know the specifics of how we are impacted. A major affect of alcohol abuse is malabsorption of vital vitamins and nutrients. Even for those who do not routinely drink to the point of vomiting or neglecting to eat, the alcohol makes it extremely difficult for the body to absorb nutrition. This often results in critically low levels of various vitamins that the body needs to function properly. Furthermore, common symptoms of various vitamin deficiencies include depression and fatigue. These are two symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as well. 

So I just want to share with anyone in recovery that taking daily vitamins and eating a nutritious diet may help tremendously with how you feel each day. It’s always important to consult a doctor for yourself of course! But I personally found out I had critically low levels of both vitamin D and potassium, despite the fact that I had no other ill effects of the alcohol appear in my tests. 

Hope this info might help others in their journey 😊",t3_nz8y1e
645,I see your struggle and I understand.,"I was a heavy drinker. It started as a coping mechanism to induce hunger after a break up in 2013. It turned into a monster.

I moved from my childhood home to NoVa and it was consistently worse. I would wake up and take 1-4 shots and then bring it to work with me to consume throughout the day. I was a literal functioning alcoholic. My significant other noticed the behavior and called me out, nothing changed. He noticed the empty bottles and nothing changed. It might’ve slowed it down a little but I just became more careful and sneaky. My blood pressure was high and I started having seizures. I ended up having multiple ones and was in medicine for it for a while. 

This all came to a head in July. I stopped eating and was only puking. I was having severe migraines, puking blood and multiple seizures at a time. I was taken to the ER where I spent a week. I didn’t care about getting better and just wanted to leave. I was released and ended back in the hospital from august 15-sept 26. I was in the ICU where I had 3 blood transfusions, placed in a medically induced coma, given a trache and feeding tube, and was given little prospects of recovering. My body was shutting down and rejecting any help. I did finally turn around once I was given the trache. I was wiened off the medicine, and oxygen. I was sent home and then started the lengthy process of learning how to walk, eat again, talk, Breathe without oxygen assistance and how to take care of myself. 

I’m now one year sober and in the best health of my life. I went through hell to get here. My drinking worsened when my dad died. He raised my sisters and I as a single parent since my mom died when we were less than 5. I know loss, I’ve lived through it my whole life. I’ve seen death first hand when I was given 72 hours to live.

I can’t tell you that I don’t miss drinking because I do. I miss the social aspects. I don’t miss the hangovers, seizures, puking, weight gain, loss of relationships and time. I see your struggle, I’ve lived it. I nearly died at 27 because of my addiction and almost became a statistic. I wish I could give you my experience so you could be inspired to stop or continue your progress but that’s a decision that you make, alone. 

I see you and I understand. I’m proud of you if you’re even a week sober, a day sober or even just saying no to that one extra swig. You have to start somewhere and where you’re at is just as good as anyone else. You are not alone and you are so loved. 

Please be patient with yourself. You’ve only just begun your story and only you can write the ending. The key is to never stop writing. Stay strong, my dears.",t3_nz2yff

648,At the lake house and haven’t even had the urge to drink!,"I came out to my in-laws lake house yesterday afternoon with my partner to spend the night and have some quiet alone time while they are away. Typically I am itching to crack a vodka soda the second we start to head out here but this time I really didn’t feel any of that. My partner isn’t a big drinker anyways so it’s nice that I don’t have to worry about watching someone else doing it around me in large amounts. We had an amazing evening, lasagna dinner, snacks, movie, fire pit! Nice early bed time and then up at 6am to have a hot coffee and watch the fish jump in the calm morning water. After that we dug new steps down to the water, mowed the whole property and have been doing odd chores all morning around the house. Now this might just seem like “normal” stuff but for me it’s not my normal when I come to the lake. Usually I would overindulge in vodka, wine etc the night before, wake up feeling like absolute shit and then sleep in and miss the entire morning while others enjoyed it. Even the sound of the mower used to bother me like “who mows this early!?” But not this time, this time it was the soothing sound of productivity for me. I’m just honestly having such a good day and can’t believe I ever thought that alcohol would enhance the LAKE like what??? I’m hearing every bird, every splash, just things I would never notice before as I sunk deeper into my “fun” day drunk. It’s just so crazy to me, myself and everyone I know at my age (27) has it drilled into us that lake time or vacay means get shitfaced. Just had to share this with you guys because I can’t believe how different I’m feeling out here today. Life is truly amazing when you aren’t living through foggy lenses. IWNDWYT!",t3_nz2drp
649,I can see it all so clearly once the veil has been lifted. It's sad that so many others are still in the dark :(,"Ever since I quit drinking about 9 or 10 months ago, my perspective towards this substance has changed drastically. I attribute a lot of that to Allan Carr's book.

I always *thought* that I loved drinking. I always *thought* that it was my drug of choice. I always *thought* that it was something that I genuinely enjoyed. 

I was a heavy drinker for about 25 years or so. I never reached the ""all day, every day"" stage of drinking, but let's just say that I ""partied"" A LOT...

After being free from this trap for 10 months now I really have no desire to fall back into my old patterns. The crippling hangovers made life EXTREMELY hard, and I really don't miss them one bit. I don't feel like shit all the time anymore. I'm actually able to be productive now...

But while I was an active drinker, I just assumed that life HAD to be that way. I assumed hangovers were an enivitable part of life. I assumed that I just had to accept that I was going to feel like shit most of the time. I assumed that I just HAD to be a drinker, because that's what we do...we drink. It didn't even cross my mind that NOT DRINKING was even an option...

To even consider not drinking is almost equivalent to saying ""I'm not going to eat food anymore"". Like, it just doesn't happen in my social circles...

It makes me very sad that most of my friends feel this way too, including my girlfriend who I have 2 kids with. Her and I partied a lot together, and we have matured a lot since having kids.

For the last 10 months she hasn't had a single drop of alcohol since she was pregnant. I quit right around the time that she first found out the news. Throughout the past 10 months I have noticed genuine concern on her part about whether or not I planned to ever start back up again. I always tell her ""maybe one day"", but I know that I am done for good.

I was hoping that she would recognize how much better she felt over the last 10 months without drinking. I was hoping that she would look at all the positive things that have happened in my life over these last 10 months...but she doesn't see it that way...

She thinks that I am starving myself of one of life's greatest pleasures. She kept talking about how she couldn't wait to have a drink when she was able to again...and of course ""have a drink"" for us means getting drunk.

We have other responsibilities now, so it's not like she is getting absolutely black out drunk. However it's only been about 1 week since she has been back in the drinking game, and she's walking around hungover, groggy...basically just feeling like shit. To her it's just the way it is. The thought of ever NOT DRINKING is absolutely absurd to her.

Our entire social circle is like this though, so it's not her fault. We were at a party yesterday, and of course everyone was slamming down the beers and shots. When we left around 9:30, the party was just starting to take off. The shots were becoming more and more frequent. Someone new had just shown up with 2 handles of Fireball. The ""fun"" was just getting started...

All I could think was how great I was going to feel when I woke up today, and that's exactly what happened. All of those people at that party are going to feel like absolute shit today. But hey, it's worth it right?!? 

The thing is...I had a GREAT TIME at this party yesterday. I keep this whole ""not drinking"" thing to myself. I never talk about it or bring any attention to it. My girlfriend is always the one to tell people that I don't drink anymore. It's seems to be a bigger deal for her than it is to me. I'm pretty good at just avoiding the conversation though, because I really don't want to make others feel uncomfortable.

However my point is that I still have just as much fun at these parties that I always did. In fact I have more fun now. The fact that I can actually have MORE fun by not drinking does not make logical sense to anyone else who is still stuck in the trap. 

The veil has been lifted for me though. I can see the destruction and chaos this alcohol shit brings. I can see how it starts out looking like ""fun"", but as the night goes on, people get tired, sick, angry, annoying, etc. It affects everyone differently, but it almost always affects them negatively. On top of that, they will all wake up today hungover as hell, feeling like absolute shit.

These problems are non-existent to me anymore. All that is required to avoid all of this chaos is to simply not drink. That's it!

Unfortunately none of my friends will ever see this clearly until the veil is lifted for them. For many of them, that will never happen. They are all so brainwashed by the fact that they have no other choice other than to drink.

If it wasn't for a very specific set of circumstances, which I attribute to pure luck...I would still be just as brainwashed as everyone else. Fortunately, I was able to make the necessary change and escape the trap.

It's only after escaping the trap that I have become so aware that ""the trap"" even exists in the first place.

So few people are aware of the trap that they are in. I truly do hope that they are eventually able to recognize it for themselves one day. I'm not going to explain it to them, or preach to them. All I can do is to simply live by example and hope that they notice 😞",t3_nywu52

653,It’s okay to be the sober one at a party,"I had a lot of anxiety as someone who gave up drinking during quarantine about what it would be like to go back to parties and bars where people are drinking.

I’ve been finding it a lot easier than I thought - even more fun! - and I wanted to share some insights from a house party I went to last night.

1) People aren’t really fixated on what you’re drinking. I usually had a can of sparkling water in my hand and it looked like a beer or one of the hard seltzers. My sobriety never came up with the people who didn’t know I wasn’t drinking. A lot of other people don’t drink or drink light than I realized 

2) Alcohol has always been a crutch for me to assuage social anxiety. I think I realized it never really erased it. There are going to be awkward moments and it’s okay. If anything, I was more social and had an easier time talking to people without being impaired

3) It is good to be of sound mind at a party, like when a guy got really drunk and wandered off into the neighborhood and I stopped all the other drunk people from going off and searching for him too 

4) My partner still drinks and I did have to push back when he kept asking me if I was doing okay in a very concerned voice. I told him in advance I might leave early if I felt uncomfortable and he interpreted that as I planned to leave early. While I appreciate the intent, it made me feel like I was being singled out and I told him to trust me to set my own boundaries and communicate if I need to leave. 

I know not everyone will have positive experiences especially if their social circles are much pushier about drinking or if it’s difficult to avoid the temptation. I’m curious how other people have found the return to parties while sober.",t3_nz28ni

I had a panic attack after I gave them all. But she was right there with me, and she told me she was going to be with me every step of the way.

Now that everything is going back to how it was, I now feel “shell shocked”. It has been so hard and I’m having a really difficult time, and the temptations are driving me insane.

I'm a 23 year old college student on an internship and with the disposable income increase, so did my drinking.  A six pack a night became the bare minimum for me over the past two years.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, living with 3 other heavy drinkers, drinking essentially became our hobby.  Whenever one of us went on a beer run we let the others know and it was just too easy to run to the store to grab some beer.

&amp;#x200B;

During COVID when bored, one of my roommates and I had a weekly ritual where we would set up lawn chairs and kill a 12 pack of Coronas each, leading to us feeling like absolute shit the next day, with me passing out around 7PM blacked out.

&amp;#x200B;

When visiting home it would be a nightly ritual for my Dad and I to get plastered as he is an alcoholic in denial.

&amp;#x200B;

I was sent over the edge 6/1 when I killed 11 drinks over a couple hours and could barely get up for work in the morning and was on the edge of throwing up for the whole day.  This day is when I came across this community and read through everyone else's story and boy did I feel ""at home.""

I went to a wedding last night and was so tempted to give in and just drink.  Thanks to my girlfriend pushing me to stick to my word I stayed sober and for that I could not be more grateful.

There are hundreds more I could add to this list but you get the picture.

Drinking did not make me more likable, sociable, funnier, or more confident. In fact, it did the exact opposite.

I only drank on weekends. But the minute I got home on Friday, I had to get completely obliterated. Moderation is not an option for me (and for most of you, I'm sure.)

1. Essentialism
2. The Alcohol Experiment
3. Alcohol Explained
4. Daring Greatly

I am now just starting “Quit Like a Woman”… not sure if it is providing me anything new.

What are some recommendations? I understand the “WHY” drinking is bad for me and the “WHAT” it does to my body. 

I am looking for the “HOW” to get my subconscious on board. 

Sometimes, the books about personal growth are just as helpful to me as the books specifically about alcohol.

666,Today is day 1,"I’m hoping that tomorrow can be day two, I had a really bad night last night which ended with self harm, I almost drink every single day, usually nothing crazy happens but if anything make me mad or sad it’s fairly common, and it’s mostly just self inflicted, I never would do anything like that sober, and I just can’t take it anymore, when I’ve been sober before I always have ended up getting on the right track and having control over my life, I just can’t take it much more and I’m really hoping I can make it stick, I was off today but my job is fairly stressful and I have to work tomorrow, I’m worried I’ll convince myself to drink during my shift, any advice on that would be helpful, thanks everyone 🙃",t3_nz87vn
667,This Felt Good,"I am just over one year without alcohol. Hasn’t been easy the whole way but here I am making it happen. 

This past weekend I was at a friend’s wedding. As many of you probably know, weddings can be really hard for non-drinkers. Anyways, we were at the rehearsal dinner Friday evening and I was ordering my go to: club soda and lime. My drinks were coming in a large plastic cup, so it was a bit more obvious than I would have liked that I wasn’t drinking. I was seated with people I see about once a year. 

About halfway through dinner, the woman sitting across from me asked what I was drinking. I told her soda water with lime. She laughed and said “no seriously, what are you having?” I replied, “water.” She laughed and pushed again, “yeah, right.” I smiled at her and said, “I’ve been sober for a year, I am drinking water.” 

The woman blushed and got extremely uncomfortable, saying she thought I must have been having double vodka sodas. Her fiancée is a hard drinker and she couldn’t fathom that I wouldn’t be drinking at a social event. She did not speak to me for the remainder of the night, nor did she attempt to make conversation at the reception. 

I tell this story because it felt really fucking good. I got sober to treat myself better so that I could treat those around me better. Situations like the one I was in Friday night reinforce to me that I am doing the right thing. It wasn’t about putting this woman in her place or embarrassing her in front of others. It was about being in total control of myself and knowing that my path is the right one for me. It was a powerful feeling and I hope you all get to experience something like this in your own way.

668,Sober weekend,This weekend I have had so much energy. No brain fog and no hangover meant I was able to feel great during everything I did. Usually I would continue with my plans and ignore the fact I wasn’t feeling 100 percent underneath. Alcohol is like such a big anchor for me. It really holds me back from living life to the fullest and the more sober weekends I have the more I see how handicapping it is.,t3_nz6zus

670,Update: Nightmare Relapse After 6 Years Sober,"I wanted to post to say that without all of the support and love I received here,  there's no way I could have left my home today.  I'm having a hard time believing I'm worth all that time you so freely gave to write but with baby steps and getting back to the fundamentals of sobriety,  my self esteem will begin to grow again. 

Here's a link to the original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/nxuyvq/nightmare_relapse_after_6_years_sober/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Upon waking up today, I was convinced I would spend the next two weeks in my room, no negotiations. After crying for a half hour while reading all of the heartfelt replies this morning,  something clicked.  I shed just enough guilt to develop the courage to go outside because I needed to get bandages and gauze pads for my wounds.  I made it to the store and got what I needed.  I went for a 30 minute walk after and the sweats that came on from that were another reminder of the abuse to my body from the inside out. 

I was eating my first significant meal since before my relapse today and sitting in a parking lot in my vehicle when the lies and illusion already started to play.  Could alcohol make me feel even more comfortable in this situation and connected to society?  Could I just use regulated drugs but lower the dose to not get paranoia for an escape from reality?  There was a young man celebrating his graduation in a tuxedo and my own drunken memories from grad came back.  I'm very lucky to not have been arrested back then, thinking about it.  

I was able to navigate my way through the thoughts above by being honest with myself and adhering to my commitment to changing my behavior. I made it home safe and tended to my wounds in an act of self care.  I must remember to take small steps now and be forever kind and focused on myself.  I wouldn't have been reminded this without all of your gentle yet perfectly directed words.

Thank you for helping me to get back onto my feet today ❤️",t3_nynjje
671,No more day 1's!!,"Hi everybody, I really feel like I need to do something different with this battle against alcohol.  I've read posts here off and on for a while now, and have struggled to stay sober for the last 4 years.  I've stopped for a few months here, a month there, a couple weeks, back and forth for years, and I'm tired of it.  I've read This Naked Mind several times, as well as read or listened to at least 5 other quit drinking books.  Every time I get on the right track, I start feeling healthier as the weeks go by, truly hating alcohol and knowing I won't bring it back in my life.  

Then I guess I let my guard down, quit reminding myself of how terrible it is, and will have a craving that I can't shake that I haven't had in a while, whether it's 3 weeks, a couple months, whenever, after I've quit.  It's like I get the smallest idea that alcohol sounds good and it slowly builds up.  I think I give in because I have this feeling of guilt for craving it, like how could I go 10 days not craving it and then it hits me out of nowhere.  Almost like I'm failing at recovery. 

Then it's just this back and forth for a while, a day drinking here, 5 days not, 2 on and one off, just this alcohol purgatory I can't get out of.  I never do anything stupid or dangerous, and don't really drink out anywhere.  Just get a six-pack IPA, get drunk watching TV/playing games and eat shitty food late.  I hate waking up in the middle of the night feeling like shit.  I'm on day 2 now, and like before I know the easy part is quitting in the short term at first, but I'm afraid of that day when I just lose control again.  

So I've decided that to do something different, I will start contributing and posting more, something that will hold me more accountable to others.  I need to try something different, and a lot of times I try to lone wolf things in my life, but I really think I need to have a community I can call on when I'm having a craving or struggling.  I hate alcohol and how it seems to keep me stuck in my life.

Thanks for reading this far, let's beat this insidious liar and thief together!! IWNDWYT!!",t3_nz05yf
672,No magical changes,"It's been 79 days, most of them spent in intensive outpatient care, and I haven't seen a single magical change. I haven't dropped any weight. (Believe me, I hoped for this one!) My skin didn't get better overnight: the dark circles didn't go away, the late-30s wrinkles are still developing. My husband and I still have arguments. I haven't shaved a minute off my mile running time or jumped one of my horses higher than ever before. I don't have before/after blood work results I can compare. My house hasn't started cleaning itself. My bank account hasn't dramatically improved -- thanks, crummy insurance, for not picking up the IOP tab!

Sometimes sobriety feels like running a race without a finish line.

Don't get me wrong -- I'm so glad to be sober, and I have no desire to start drinking again. But I'm really envious of people who see immediate changes. Maybe the three month milestone will give me some result I can point to and say, ""Look what sobriety did for me!"" I suppose I'll find out soon enough.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I lurk a lot under my main username and started this one up just to post here.

673,Heart Problems at 36 - Must Stop Drinking for Good,"I wasn’t sure if I wanted to write a post or not, but I decided it might be good for me to do so. So here goes. I was recently diagnosed with heart failure at a relatively young age - 36. I’m physically fit, very active, I eat (fairly) healthy, and I look “completely fine.” No one, including my cardiologist, can really believe what is happening to me, and no one can explain why. In order to let my body heal to the best of its ability, I have had to take serious medication, stop drinking alcohol, stop consuming caffeine, and make some other minor lifestyle changes. 

In the past, I have read posts and comments in this thread that have helped me moderate my drinking. Although I’ve never spoken out, this group has aided me a great deal when I’ve tried to stop drinking for long stretches. I’m thankful to all that you have done for me already. But this time…..well…this time things have to be different. I know I have done bad things to my body over the years; one of those things has been drinking too much. 

The seriousness of this diagnosis means I cannot ever justify drinking again. A lot of things related to this health problem are outside of my control, but abstaining from alcohol is something I have within my power to do. 

It’s been a week and so far things have been okay. I have not been symptomatic with respect to my heart ailment and I continue to feel physically fine. My mental state is ragged, however. I worry all the time about dying and leaving my young children without a father. In response to this worry, a voice pops up in my head and says, “You know what would calm your nerves? A drink.” 

I know, based on what I’ve learned from this group, that I must strive to defeat that voice. My life - my future existence - all of the great things I have left to do - all of this matters more than drinking. 

I’ll continue drawing support from this group during the tough days and weeks ahead. Thank you in advance and I wish you all the best.",t3_nyokwc
674,Glad to find this sub.,"I’m going on 20 months sober. It’s been a rollercoaster of feelings and life changing decisions. Without alcohol I’ve been able to think for myself and separate from not only toxic habits, but toxic people that came with the substance. All I want to say is you can do it. It might not be easy, but it will be worth the hard nights and even mornings of urges to fall through.",t3_nz3vkh
675,Any bartender code words to make non alcoholic drinks? Tips and tricks?,"You know besides the word virgin.  I’m so proud of myself I quit cold and am motivated to keep going.  Almost two weeks sober and feeling great.  Water during parties and club soda at airport bars (airport was the toughest).  I’m worried about bars with coworkers and clients, it’s a part of the job and I’m not ready nor do I want to share how deep down the hole I went. 

So for those who still go out what tips and tricks do you do?",t3_nz5kwt
676,My first sober (belly button) birthday,"I celebrate my birthday today. My first ever sober one since I was about 15, that’s 17 years of drunk birthdays. Usually, I would drink the whole week because it’s my birthday week, why not??

So even though there have been a few slips lately, this is still a massive win, which I will take! There were even a number of triggers that I avoided, like out for dinner (with some uncomfortable family members). However, I have consumed a lot of sugar!

One of the reasons I was able to not drink was depression. Last week was especially bad and I know drinking alcohol makes this a whole lot worse. I also know it was triggered by drinking. I thought I could just have a few the weekend before which ended in the usual way. Followed up by the usual unrelenting anxiety and depression. This bout was particularly bad, I skipped the gym, work and social responsibilities. I could not face being around people, especially people that were drinking. 

It amazes me that in so many areas of my life I am “in control” or able to learn from mistakes, yet drinking I just can’t seem to learn from. How many times do I have to wake up unable to move because I might throw up, wondering what the fuck happened, how I got home, who I talked to, who I text, what I said, why is my dress ripped? Why do I only have one earring? Where is my bag? FUCK. And now I’ve wasted an entire day that I had planned to exercise, meal prep for the week, you know, really start my week right. FUCKING AGAIN???? Like how many times does my dumb alcoholic ass need to do this?

I managed to pick myself up, dust myself off and not spiral into a drinking tornado that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few months. I showered, got some washing on, managed to finally keep some food down and made a plan for the week. 

Every time this happens I try to go back to what I know works and look for where it unfolded so I can put something in place to avoid that happening again. 

This particular event was one of those alcohol inclusive 3 courses, I was on the fence about drinking before I went as there were a few people there that I didn’t know very well. I panicked and accepted the first drink. Next time, I will decide before I go that I am not drinking. I will practice in the mirror saying no thanks followed by my order of a non alcoholic beverage. The people I was with probably would have understood my plight if I had been honest with them. Oh well, we live and learn. I just have to say no to the first one. and now for some more birthday treats :)",t3_nza3j1
677,Daughter made travel soccer team!,"This may seem like a non-related post, but it’s not. We’re in a hectic period with her high school team still in playoffs, but travel team tryouts are occurring this weekend. Her previous team fell through due to too many girls graduating. In a furious late Saturday night, I had to email and call several other clubs into the night and inquire. We had guests over for dinner and they stayed late - and they wanted to drink and drink and drink. I had water. Well - We got a few replies from some of the clubs. One said to show up at 8AM. We got there and they said they were disbanding their team too. But he suggested we try another club. We went there and they said to come back at 6. We tried a third club - and he said to show up at 10AM at a field an hour away. So we sprinted there. Got her registered and in the field and as I tell all my kids - I can get you to the field and in front of a coach, but you have to do the rest. And boy did she show up - she ran hard, moved the ball well, multiple assists and shots. She played HARD. Sure enough one of the coaches made us an offer and gave us a contract. We got back in the car and it was noon - blaring white stripes on the stereo and snap chatting the whole way home. We had an incredible day. Drinking tea, dancing around the house, the vibe was rocking. Dare I say - our home looked like a beer advertisement with so many people having such a good time. 

In normal past times, none of this would’ve happened. None of it. I’d have been drunk the night before and never would’ve made all those phone calls. And then even if I had -  I never would have even woken up at 7 to get her into her gear and to the field - because I would’ve been hungover. Honestly - I’d still be in bed even now. I lived more life this morning than I did in entire years while I was drinking. 

So I know it’s been said before. But as I look around, ice water in hand, watching out house explode with joy and positivity I’ll say it again because it’s so true. “Sobriety delivers what alcohol promises”.",t3_nz5by5

679,That Morning Smell...,"I woke up early this morning and took a deep breath in. I could smell the flowers, the air, the trees, and my coffee. I haven't had this sensation in the morning for months. All I could remember was that smell in my nose in the morning, the smell of hangover. 

My receptors were so damaged and dry from the amount of poison I put in my body the day before I couldn't even smell my coffee. All my brain could make of what my receptors were sending was; ""stale air with a slight whiff of putridness that seems to be an amalgamation of drinking and bar smells"". These were my mornings and I accepted them, no more. 

Take a deep breath and enjoy EVERYTHING around you.

680,What have I done?,"Hi, I’m 23 and yesterday I blacked out. I cannot believe the magnitude of what I have done. I was too loud, I was obnoxious, I was disgusting. I was out with my introverted boyfriend and his brother at a small comedy show. We barely ever go out... it took so much for me to convince him to come to the show. I was so excited for the night. Oh god, oh god, it ended so badly. If he never goes out with me again, I will completely understand.

I woke up at 6 AM this morning next to him. I felt good for a moment before the horrible realization that I didn’t remember anything past the end of the show. What had I done? What had I said? I looked down at my clothes and realized that I was in the same pink romper that I went out in. Oh no. My boyfriend was asleep next to me. I waited in agony for hours for him to wake up and tell me what had happened. 

My boyfriend was sober last night. He watched me have drink after drink and get too drunk - too rowdy. I was embarrassing at the show, calling out comedians from the front row. We left the show right after it ended. I staggered down the street to his car, I cried and held his hand, I puked when we got home. I told him I loved him when we haven’t even said that to each other yet. (The relationship is 7 months old.) I tried to kiss him after I puked. I slurred out apology after apology the whole night. He was repulsed.

My boyfriend is the best thing that ever happened to me and I am disgusted by my actions. If he breaks up with me I will completely deserve it. I cannot ever drink like that ever again. I used to drink a lot in college but I graduated last year and said to myself that it was behind me. Clearly I cannot trust myself around alcohol. I am awful.",t3_nz1e62
681,1 Year Anniversary,"I just had my 1 year anniversary being sober from alcohol. It was an amazing milestone for me, because I chose to stop when shit was hitting the fan with the pandemic, socio-political unrest, and a time when most were reaching for something to take off the edge. 

I just want to say for anyone going through it, it literally is a “one day at a time” lifestyle, which I was kind of cynical about when I decided to quit. I had never had a drinking problem, per se…but isn’t that how it starts?!

My life changed drastically, my social circle got significantly smaller and the phone rang/chimed significantly less. The true friends were so fucking awesome and supportive, so even going the extra mile to make it a point to not drink around me. You’ll win some, lose some, and strengthen existing relationships during this journey. 

Sorry for the long rant, but I pop in from time to time and never shared my experience. But, I’m hoping this will give others the strength and courage to continue because we are all worthy and deserving of happiness in this crazy fucking life experience. lol.",t3_nz4vmi

683,Self Medicating,"Stop me if I said this already, but I've been self medicating my schizoaffective disorder with alcohol. 6 weeks sober and all of my symptoms are coming out of the woodwork. I'm maxed out on all my medications. Cant go to a higher dose.

Its fucking rough, guys. My work performance has been abysmal, and if I dont get my act together I'm going to start losing clients and employees.

684,Sugar,I’m wondering if anyone has advice about how to manage sugar cravings that seem to be lasting quite a long time? (I thought maybe after 5 months they would have dissipated but no no they have not).  What are other people’s experiences? Any good tips?,t3_nzeycw
685,Eye opening realization-it takes daily commitment,"I wanted to share in hope it help someone in a similar situation. I recognized that I do not have a healthy relationship with alcohol at the end of last year. (Bottle of wine per day average) I have quit for nearly a month at a time. Sober October, Sober January, etc..and Then due to some stressor I would pick it back up and the same old boring pattern continues… 

What I realized is that just as it takes a DAILY action to form a habit. It takes a DAILY action to break a habit.

If I commit EVERY single day to practicing wellness and put effort in time into consciously and actively not drinking, I will not drink.

The moment I am passive about quitting- my subconscious takes over and the drinks start again. 

It is inevitable (for me) to continue this pattern unless I am making sobriety a daily habit. For example, if I utilize this Reddit, read a book to learn more about the effects of alcohol, or actively discuss with people who support me- every day-one activity to battle the habit. I can do it.

688,Ahh well i’ll see where this goes,"Been an alcoholic since I first touched it. Felt normal, social able, safe. This would’ve been when I was about 14. But since then it was always about drinking. At a party I didn’t enjoy anything but drinking...

Smoked weed for a good 3 years staying functional asf (19-22). Was a good time in my life I guess, especially when I compare it to this hole i’m currently in.

I went through a messy breakup few months ago, which led to a hardcore bender (alcohol &amp; xanax). I had had about 12 fake bars, knew they were pressed but I genuinely didn’t care at the time. I proceeded to drive on them thinking I was invincible, which ended in a pretty bad crash where I cut the guy off and got t bonned. No one got hurt thank god, that’s really the only positive I was able to retain from this series of events. I had no insurance and am now about 13k in debt.

I fucked up real hard, it’s been months now and I still feel like a piece of shit. In my mind I feel this way because I think I am one.

I had to move back in with my parents and recently over the past few weeks i’ve just fallen back into this shit. My life will continue to get worse the more i drink but i struggle to find any joy in honestly anything. 

I’m now sitting at a point where i’ve convinced myself i’ve fucked up my life and instead of changing anything i’m kind of just ready to burn and die. 

Obviously i’d take everything back if i could, like anyone would. But I can’t and that’s reality. I’m in insane amounts of emotional discontentedness because of no one else but myself. 

Recently my alcohol use has been pretty bad. I’m 24 drink anywhere from 8-30 standards a night, I have occasional days off but they are filled with misery where i just reflect on the piece of shit I am. I want to go rehab but it costs 12-15k a month or a 6 month waiting list.

I’m so sick of this life I just want to change.

I’m on my 5th day of sobriety after 7 years of regular drinking and binge drinking. I thought I had it under control but particularly since COVID started it has gotten out of control. It’s put incredible strain on my relationship with my partner and my life in general.

Although I got cravings over the weekend, today has been the hardest day so far by a mile. The full weight of my problem over the past few years has sunk in - it feels like I’ve been living with tunnel vision for 7 years. I’ve tried to moderate before, but I’m quitting for good this time because I really see the damage drinking has done to me. I feel ashamed and anxious at how bad it got and how I was able to constantly lie to myself in order to feed my addiction. I’m hoping it isn’t too late to repair my relationships with the people I’ve hurt with my drinking.

This sub has been an incredible resource - I knew I wanted to quit, but reading the stories of everyone here really helped me understand my own situation and just how much I’ve lied to myself.

I'm a couple of months clean, I think I got off easy as although I drank for a little under 3 years almost every day in excess, I didn't really have withdrawal beyond some gnarly stomach cramps for a day or two, and haven't really been tempted by cravings. My question is, I'm getting married in a few months, and after putting down my own deposit (neither family are in a position to help out, so I'm soloing it), I realised I'm essentially paying thousands of dollars for a drinks package and a meal. My partner is also very keen on having a bottle of Dom Perignon to toast with. Is it breaking my sobriety streak if I have a couple of glasses in toasts at my own wedding?

All the money I am saving from not drinking and by proxy the money I'm saving from not making bad decisions or better said impulsive decisions is being redirected to my goals. 30 year mortgage will be done in 5 years, I hiked a 14er which was a feet; on a saturday... which is when I would normally be regretting the night before. So I guess this is what normal life is. You get shit done, you drive to goals, and you make something you can hold on to  and be proud of with your life. Things are just... normal. I like it.

701,Not numbing out is hard.,"Not numbing out is really fucking hard all of a sudden. 

I was not aware how mentally ill I feel without booze. My thought patterns and belief systems are horrendous. No wonder I drank, I didn’t want to feel or think any of these thoughts I am having. Alcohol helped me banish all of the nonsense in my head. 

Here is a sort of stream of consciousness to illustrate what has gone through my mind the last 3 days: 

I am deeply insecure. Angry. Hate myself. Hate myself for being human. I feel embarrassed and ashamed for even existing. I feel jealous of my friends who are in good shape. I feel horrendously insecure and angry to find out my friend got a tattoo and is now getting it removed, all without me knowing. She kept it a secret and I feel like an unpopular loser that she didn’t tell me. Why would anyone want me around? I am an insecure loser. People know I am dumb. They all know I am an idiot and a drunk. No wonder they want nothing to do with me. I am worthless and people only keep me around on the outskirts of their lives because they feel obligated. I will never be someone’s first choice for a friend.
I am so fucking angry. I hate myself. I really hate who I am. I am not smart or special or interesting. I am not capable of a good life, and people can sense it and keep me at arms length.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies. Your feedback is insightful, kind, encouraging, and deeply appreciated. I am 14 days sober today and genuinely shocked at how dark my thoughts are. I am really

702,22yr friendship lost,"I had to let go of a long term friendship recently.

Seems to be a common theme since I've started moving closer to sobriety.

I've lost 3 close ""friends"" in the past year.

One thing I've learned is some people only love you when you're serving them.

Once you try to rise up and move out of addiction, the people who thrived on your addiction begin to resent you, disrespect you and your boundaries. 

That's when you have to start the lonely painful process of shedding that dead weight.

This is where healing starts. 

I don't know what's after yet..

But I am making a commitment to my first day 1.

Just posting to say it out loud- I’m struggling. I’m sober, but I’m struggling. My mind has been nothing but constant chatter of the back and forth. Drink! Don’t drink! Drink! Don’t drink! 
IWNDWYT",t3_nz4xji
705,First Check In/Hello (And a few questions!),"Hi all,  
I have lurked here for a while and I have had several unsuccessful quit attempts before but I am finally ready to give it a real shot and with that in mind I decided to also take the step and join all you people here. I have been a bit of a problem drinker for a long time now and it has been only escalating and getting worse. Every time previous I have either quit because someone else wanted me too or I wasn't ready to accept the reality of the situation I was in. Neither work too well as I am sure many of you know!  


I just wanted to give that little introduction before moving on to the main reason I am posting tonight. I'm only just coming up to a week (Same with smoking) but over this week I have been doing a lot of soul searching and thinking and I have had a few thoughts and questions pop into my head and they have just been bouncing around endlessly like a pinball machine and I was hoping one or two of you amazing people may have some insight / a better path or way of thinking for me.   


I hope you don't mind me just numbering them and getting straight into it.  


1: What is the best way to tackle that voice in your head that sows doubt?   
I have had a lot of thoughts such as, ''You've been drinking so long - you can't be anything without it, you won't have the energy, personality, confidence, you'll effectively become someone new and you were happy/fine before'' Now I know that on paper,  becoming someone new after quitting a toxin such as this is a 100% good thing but right now its almost as if.. it seems bad to me? In a really stupid way. I can't really articulate what I mean on this. It's almost.. scary? Having to face the world sober after being in a cloud so long.  It kind of makes me feel super vulnerable in a way and what happens when I start to feel that way? I start to think of drinking to kill that off... Ridiculous isn't it? My main question here is: Is this thought process likely to fade with more time? What are some effective ways of catching it and trying to turn it around?   


2: Sometimes I can read posts on here and they can truly help and other times I read something and again that voice will come and say ''See, you aren't as bad as that person, you never drank that much, you don't actually have a problem you can have 1-2 this weekend don't worry about it''.  This I really hate because I can spend a week telling myself I won't drink, a full week and it only takes 10-20 seconds of thinking this way to undo all of that work. It's something I have recognised and really want to be on top of this time, so again I guess my question is: What's the best way of dealing with this kind of thought process?   


Apologies for this being so long and apologies again if this is really trivial stuff to a lot of you. I honestly feel kind of stupid even writing some of it out because it just sounds crazy to me when I read it back that I can't figure some of it out on my own. If you got this far thanks for reading all the way - I really did not intend this to be as long as it got!",t3_nz4umv
706,Yay did NOT drink at bar with coworkers last night,"Just proud of myself. Been a long time coming. It helps that ive grown some hatred for alcohol. But can we really overcome things we hate? Or must we learn to love them to truly overcome the issue? Idk sounds complicated. Maybe its about people and not booze.

707,Restaurant/ Trigger,"Today hubby and I made it to 9 months sober. Whoah!  We were able to have a day, just us, and headed to Breckenridge, CO.

Anyhow, polished off my water drove SAFELY home and there will be no hangover tomorrow or fight with my hubby tonight.  The little victories add up and makes my resolve stronger.  Day by day, min by min.  Today I chose myself and my health. Thank you all for your support. IWNDWYT",t3_nyo863
708,Opening up about my problem costed me everything,"Everything has its consequences. Ive been reallying struggling for a while to stop drinking, and i have my highs and my lows, with each low getting lower. we all likely know how that goes. finding rock bottom and all. 

in my time trying to quit, ive opened up to friends and family. ive been given advice, and have followed or chosen not to follow different things. im imagining the ones i chose to skip are the things that may have fixed me. 

anyways, the people around me have essentially given up, and i dont blame them. in a way, ive also given up. it makes sense at this point. i can only imagine how frustrating it must be watching a good friend go in and out of the recover process like i have time and time again, always making the same mistake and always taking the wrong turn. all i have to do is stop, and i cant seem to manage. theyve grown obviously tired of me talking about it as well. i thought opening up to my social circle would be helpful, but all it has done as pushed them away over time.  

i dont even like drinking anymore, not a single part of it. i dont have fun. i dont laugh. every emotion i feel while drunk is negative and hostile towards myself and things around me. anger, sadness, null, everything. the only part of drinking that i even enjoy anymore is the first drink, because i finally know the struggle to not drink that day is over. ive given in, and i can try again tomorrow. that relief is the only part i enjoy. 

i want to quit, i know i do. otherwise i wouldnt post to a subreddit designed to help me stop. theres no logic there. even as im writing this all out, im telling myself"" once we get done with this, well run to the  store and grab some light beers,"" knowing good and well, consciously, that i dont want to. knowing good and well that it wont make me happy. knowing good and well itll make tomorrow that much worse. 

i wish i had health insurance. i wish i didnt have this stupid anxiety that makes AA meetings a trainwreck for me. i wish i didnt feel like shit all the time. i wish my family would take it seriously when i tell them, hell i wish theyd file a mental hygiene on me and get me put in rehad or detox or something. i dont even care anymore i just want to be better. ive literally looked into simple ways to get put in jail for a week or two just to detox. mostly though thats just a passing thought, but thats how desperate im starting to feel.",t3_nz4gze

My husband has given up drinking for good after years of struggle and finally blowing a .2 and getting charged with a DUI. He is finally ready to stop and I am 1000% with him and happy for him and I will not drink again either. I just can see how sad he gets when he has to tell someone he doesn't drink. People can't just say ""ok"" it always turns into an interrogation. And I know he doesn't want to tell people about the DUI. And I know he then feels shitty about himself. Idk. I guess I don't know how to explain it. Idk what to do to make him feel better. I point out in not drinking with him but I was never a big drinker so to him it doesn't matter because I didn't really drink anyway.

Then yesterday I had a different friend call me from the hospital. This friend and their wife had just had a baby, who's unfortunately been have been having a few medical issues. They've been stuck in the hospital almost a whole week. Anyways, the call came in at like 8pm, and they asked if I could give a ride home to one of them so they could get some sleep. And I said, not a problem, glad to help. Drove over there in 10 minutes, leaving my childhood friend, who had already burned through a couple tallboys. I would have been right there with him 6 months ago. I was so grateful to have been available to help. It's really nice to be ready at any time to show up for life, and for the people you love, especially in hard times.

717,Kept drinking even though it was literally crippling me,"For nearly a decade I’ve had 3/4 bottle of wine per night (leaving the extra 1/4 made me feel better lmao). 

Never had more than that, just made me chatty and cheerful, sometimes a bit irritable in the morning, so I convinced myself it was fine and I could stop any time.

In January, I started having nasty nerve pain all over, especially my legs. 

Doctor diagnosed me with a rare auto immune disorder at 35 — thanks COVID — and explicitly told me that alcohol would exacerbate it due to inflammation. 

After unsuccessfully searching for studies to prove alcohol doesn’t worsen inflammation (lol), I still convinced myself my doctor was wrong, and kept at my nightly habit for months, to the point where I could barely walk due to the pain. 

Limping home one morning and groaning in agony, I sat down in the middle of the sidewalk to do the Peter Griffin “eshhh ahhh” with my knees, and then started laughing at myself like a crazy person. 

Was I seriously crippling myself for Merlot...?

I’m now 2 days without a drink. Not particularly impressive, but the longest I’ve gone in 10+ years.

720,Regulating emotions,"I am sure I am not the only one who tried to self regulate with drinking. Dulling the senses, getting less sensitive. If course it doesn't work long time because alcohol has the opposite effect. It's not calming, it's nerve wrecking. 

I feel like I am having a bit of trouble regulating myself. I am highly sensitive and sometimes it's not easy to keep my cool. I get upset easily (also excited easily)... Not drinking is definitely helping to improve the emotional instability but I still struggle to regulate myself. I accept that I get overstimulated and that i have a overtime working nervous system. I know I need my day off, not too much caffeine, breaks, yoga, structure...

721,Watch it come and watch it go.,"Life has been so stressful lately. My wife and I got some horrible health news about two family members. Because of this, we’ve decided to move back home to TN from CO. 

Dealing with the health news, on top of getting our house ready for sale, putting it on the market, and shuffling around for all the showings, I’ve completely abandoned all self care. I haven’t meditated, I’ve only worked out a few times, I’ve been eating junk food because it’s quick and easy. 

But I haven’t had a drink. 

I’ve had so many emotions flow thru me the last three weeks. But, I read on hear my first week of sobriety to just “watch them come and watch them go.” Emotions are the hardest part of sobriety but I’ve learned to watch them like clouds in the sky, and it’s been life-changing.

However, my feelings have been all over the place. I feel like they're finally trying to organize themselves as something cohesive and I am finally facing the facts of all the shit that's happened to me the past 10 years that I never dealt with. I realized that I've never dealt with the pain of any of my relationships ending, heartbreaks, deaths, loss of my dog, and it feels so fucking daunting. Last year my therapist of 6-7 years gave me alcohol in a session, the week after I finally admitted to him (and myself) about my substance abuse. I am still wary of trusting other people so I don't really know who to turn to right now. I know that I should learn to rely on myself and not place expectations on other people, but I don't really have people in my life who understand and I am just feeling really lost.

725,Had a fun night out with coworkers,"I went to a coworker’s cottage. We were all there with our partners/wives, etc. Everyone was drinking except me and my wife (me because I’m in recovery, my wife because she just didn’t feel like drinking). A few people were smoking weed.

We grilled a bunch of food and had a big bonfire.

I had a great time. I haven’t laughed so hard and had so much fun in a while. It’s really nice that even after a few years of this, I can still have experiences with people who aren’t in recovery and are using drugs and alcohol and have a great time. It really reaffirms that I’m making the right choice, one day at a time.

The other thing that’s cool is my coworkers know my deal and we can be open about it with each other. They don’t have any issues with substances and can recreationally enjoy them in moderation. They’re very considerate of me but I’m at a point where I’m very comfortable having folks enjoy substances around me. If that wasn’t the case, they’d try to accommodate me.

I had invited my best friend over last night for a bonfire and some brats. I told him I was not drinking this weekend (I have not announced my sobriety as an event to everyone I feel like it helps me stay sober) but he brought wine for himself and for me and basically convinced me to throw my sobriety out the window. Then took me downtown when I was blacked out. When he showed up with two bottles of wine, I told him that I was trying to stop drinking because I felt like I had a problem. But he's very pushy and persuasive and... Fuck. 

I woke up this morning with scrapes on my hands and my knees and bruises on my arms. I don't know why or how they got there. I miss how good I felt earlier this week when I hadn't drank.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

732,"No, we cannot f#+k you if you're drunk","Hey everyone. I've been on this board for awhile but was starting to get trolled on my main account so I setup a new one for safety. 

I've been working to through some stuff lately.  I'm 23 days sober and I'm trying recover from a decade of alcohol abuse. I've decided not to date during my first year of sobriety but that doesn't stop me from engaging in my other bad behavior--texting exes. 

Being sober has made me realize I crave the dopamine rush of texting an ex. So I did tonight. Someone I dated for a month who broke things off because he said he didn't want something serious and I really liked him. I'm really struggling with my disregard for people's boundaries and putting my own needs first in these situations.

I consider myself someone who's really giving, even if I don't get it back. But in these situations I just feel like I take. And it's really hard to think through, why I do this stuff. Especially when people tell me that they'd rather not.

Tonight I texted an ex. I had seen online that he was out drinking, so when I texted him he laid into me about how I was disrespecting his boundaries, and that he expressed what he wanted and it wasn't what I wanted. Of course these things hurt to hear, but no one had ever really told me how I made them feel. So, I was actually really grateful that he let me know how I made him feel so I can make sure not to do it again because I know it doesn't make him feel good when I text him.

Another thing that happened in the course of the conversation, was that he oddly invited me over. It was late, I knew what he wanted. I knew he wanted to have sex, and it wasn't even that it was with me it was just sex.

I feel like in the past, given all the ups and downs, I would have jumped at the opportunity and been like okay I'll be there in 20 minutes! However newly sober me was like no, you were just sad and that's why you texted him. You don't actually want to see this person.

So I let him know hey, I think if you we're sober you actually wouldn't be interested in this and I don't think you actually want me, so it's not a good idea.

Anyway! The whole thing was a roller coaster that had me reexamining why I do the things I do and use men as a coping mechanism and a way to avoid my feelings. I feel like what he shared gave me a lot to think about. I definitely feel like there's sometimes when you should disregard what other say to you about your actions, because their opinion doesn't really matter. But I actually felt this time it was really helpful! And instead of lowering my standards and goals, I told him how I felt in that I didn't think he actually wanted me specifically.

I'm wondering if anyone else struggles with contacting eX's as a coping mechanism. Along with drinking, this is definitely one of my high up unhealthy coping mechanisms.

I'm also struggling with feeling like I'm trying to change everything all at once. So I'm trying to give some grace to myself and realize that I can't just change overnight, and then I'm still going to make mistakes.",t3_nyrhw3
733,"I Want To Cut Back Drinking, but My Best Friend/Neighbor is an Alcoholic","This is a long one so please forgive me. I've never spoken about my drinking to anyone before, even those closest to me, so my articulation might be a bit messy, but this community seems like a group of really wonderful people and I'd appreciate any help or advice you have to offer.

I'm a single/childless woman in my early 30s whose chronic anxiety has gone off the charts. I've always had anxiety problems and was diagnosed with GAD a long time ago, but now it's my hangxiety that's really I think ruining my mental health. If I get drunk one night (4/5+ drinks), the next morning I get these horrible panic spells that last for hours. Sometimes days. I literally feel like I'm going to die during them. And because the world is coming to life again post-COVID, it means going out with friends I haven't seen in a year generally results in binge drinking. It feels like a release. But I binged three times in the last week and the anxiety has genuinely been unbearable. I feel like a prisoner in my own brain, and I know that the correlation between anxiety and my drinking is pretty clear-cut. (If any of you have quit alcohol for anxiety-related reasons and it helped you, btw, please let me know. Would love to hear your stories.)

I love a gorgeously crafted cocktail, I love having a glass of nice wine at dinner. If I'm situations like being out for a meal I can completely handle myself and cut myself off at 1-2 drinks and I'm fine the next day. But if I'm at a bar, or have friends round at home, I will go all night. My hangovers are awful and like I mentioned before, the hangxiety is horrendous. I've decided to really cut back and try only drinking if I'm out to dinner at a restaurant, no exceptions. (I'm open to going completely sober one day, but I know I'm not quite there yet, and I'd rather set a realistic standard for myself that I know I can stick to.) There's just one issue: my best friend. Best friend is an understatement. She's more like my sister.

She lives across the hall in the same apartment building as me, so we are always in very close proximity to one another - physically and emotionally. She's a bartender at a Michelin-starred restaurant and is around alcohol all the time and has to drink as part of her job, but she is also, unfortunately, an alcoholic. She's pretty self-aware about it but always laughs it off. She's an incredible person - so kind, funny, warm and luminous. But she's not a great drunk. She can get mean and self-centered. The other night she tripped and smashed her face in concrete and her chin has a massive bruise. She thought it was hilarious. She's had a DUI in the past but it didn't impact her drinking at all. I've been concerned about her habits for a long time. I know that I can't cut down on drinking without her help and support, but the first time I mentioned I wanted to cut back (or do a 30 day sober challenge), she said, ""Please don't do that to me."" I know that basically means that if I cut back, it'll force her to confront her own issues in the face too, and she sees me as a partner in crime and fellow booze connoisseur and doesn't want to lose me there. But a drink that costs $20 and is made with organic and beautiful ingredients in a classy place is still a drink. I desperately am hoping that that we can sustain a friendship like we did when we we first met as teenagers that doesn't revolve around partying. When we hang out sober we have a lovely time. But I lately can't stand being around her when she's drunk, and that's almost every single day at this point.

My ground rules would basically be as mentioned above: I'll only drink if I go out to dinner 1-2x a week (WHILE I'm at dinner, not before or after) - but I also know I can't be around anyone who has been drinking. Especially her. I'm sure people will say if she can't accept those terms, then she isn't really my friend, but I think it's more complicated than that. I think she will somehow interpret me telling her this as a judgment on her. I'm totally fine telling her, ""We can hang out, have coffee together all the time, we can even go out to dinner for a glass of wine - but I'm stopping it there."" I don't know how to then say ""I also can't be around you if you've been drinking"" without it coming off as judgmental, but it's true: I simply can't. I think she will definitely drink in secret sometimes and still come over and try to act sober; she's done that before. I have so much anxiety about telling her this, and that she'll react judgmentally or pull away to avoid dealing with her own inner demons. I realize I can't control that. But I already feel lonely and anxious as it is, and I feel like being isolated is going to exacerbate my anxiety and depression even more.

I don't want to cut her out of my life completely (moreover, I can't - again, she's across the hall, so this makes everything even more complicated and I'm always going to be around it). Have you ever had to deal with something like this? Would so appreciate any advice. Thank you so much.",t3_nz5jnc
734,2 years today!,"I (27, F) am currently on a college friend’s bachelorette party and everyone has been partying all weekend and I could not be happier that I’m not drinking! There was one point last night when we were on our way back to the house after going to the bar and we were all singing along to random pop songs and I couldn’t stop smiling. It was something I wouldn’t have been apart of if I were still drinking because I would have either had to have someone take me back home early because I was too drunk, or I would have been blacked out and not remembered. Being able to be sober and present around the people who probably saw the worst of my drinking is such a gift. I love this life and IWNDWYT!!!!!",t3_nyflcy
735,How did you start?,"I (27M) have come to realize I am a full blown alcoholic. I almost tried to kill myself last night, but I ended up just passing out on the floor instead. I am ashamed, embarrassed, and lost. I come from a loving and supportive family, just graduated with my MBA and MS, and am a god damn alcoholic. I want to see better days, but I just don’t know where to start. It feels like I’m lost in the woods without a compass. I just want to know from some of you veterans how you were able to take the first steps. At this point I know it’s coming down to life or death and truly want to be/get better.",t3_nyxtdc

737,Why did you decide to stop drinking?,"I have quite a high-stress job and I am quite sure that my nightly de-stress of 1 or 2 bottles of wine are putting me off my game the next day. But having said that, my whole social life revolves around alcohol. It seems I’d be taking almost as much away from my life (relaxation and socialising) as I would be giving back (in increased productivity).

Worth mentioning I have had a quite a few blackouts and legal “incidents”, but not for a while now as I’ve grown up. How do you guys make the justification to give up your social lives for the benefits you will get by giving up alcohol? I mean I know you can say that you can socialise sober, but all my mates are big drinkers and to be honest it just sounds kind of boring... 

I suppose my question is, did most of you have a classic “rock-bottom” or did you just make more of a “lifestyle” decision and decide you were better off without?",t3_nyu1ga

740,Remembering why I stopped drinking,"My province has been in and out of lockdown since last summer and tonight was the first time I’ve been to a party since I decided to stop drinking. At first I felt super left out as everyone was playing drinking games and having fun and I felt like I was missing out on something. However, it is now the end of the night and someone has been puking for almost an hour and I remember why I decided to stop drinking. I was never able to tell where my limit was and I would often be the one throwing up and ruining everyone’s night. Just because I never got to the point where I was drinking every day didn’t mean I didn’t have a problem. Every time I would start drinking I never knew when to stop. I did and said a lot of things that I’m not proud of and I’m sure a lot more that I don’t remember. Tonight I am reaffirmed in my choice not to drink. If anything, I at least never again want to be the reason a party ends poorly and everyone goes home with a bad memory.

749,Three weeks,"For the first time since I was probably 13, am 29, I have gone three weeks without drinking. I had a terrible stomach virus that made me unable to hold ANYTHING in for close to two weeks so this feels a little like a cheat. Holy shit tho, I feel so good. No real cravings besides a passing want for a Margarita the other day. Being sick really did a number on me, never been THAT sick that long and was a bit of a wake up call when I went to the doctor. I was scared about my stomach but they were scared about my blood pressure and drinking. Now I have my own blood pressure monitor and a pill prescription, daily reminders that beer isn't just ""fun"". I've been neglecting my health for years and am blown away by how much different I feel compared to a month ago. I don't have a scale but have gone down 3 belt loops and feel far more energetic than I did before. Really hoping to keep this sobriety going. Feel like I'm finally doing my life a favor and getting out of this mindset of ""I'll be dead by 30, fuck it."" That I've had since middle school.

751,Feeling Lonely in Sobriety,"Good evening everyone! I wanted to start out by thanking all of you beautiful people for being such an amazing support group. I am so thankful for this safe space for us all to encourage each other to better our lives. 

That being said I am finding it very lonely maintaining my sobriety as of late. I am currently not in a mindset that I feel safe attending social outings that involve others drinking at the moment. Unfortunately it's led to me being a bit of a recluse.  I feel like a burden and an annoyance in my circle. Now that restrictions are lifting, everyone I know wants to ""celebrate"" and ""go out on the town"". Even going to dinner with a group of friends turns into them wanting to go drinking instead. 

It's very disheartening. First, I've noticed the people I've been surrounding myself with and that's made me feel all the more lonely. Discovering that people I've considered close friends for the past few years were more just drinking buddies is a pretty big blow. 

I know I'll find better relationships, but right now it kind of sucks.

Here's to better days to come, but I just needed to get this off of my chest since it's been weighing heavy on my mind. 

46 days sober and counting. 

I will not drink with you today.",t3_nynnzm
752,Interesting observation,"I've been moreso moderating than completely quitting, but even then, I've been limiting to maybe max one drink a week. I've found that primarily I've just lost interest in drinking since starting this journey, so that's helped. 

Last night I had about a glass and a half of wine, something I haven't had in almost 3 weeks and used to be my poison of choice. Found that I didn't even really enjoy it and could already feel the beginnings of a headache before I was finished. Chugged some water before bed and went to sleep. 

When I woke up this morning, I felt fine physically, but what I noticed mentally is just an added reason as to why drinking isn't for me anymore - I'm angry and pissy and my fuse is short. My son (6 years old) is being his normal chatty and clingy self and I'm finding I just don't have the patience for it today. All because of the wine.

So, while it may not be a ""physical"" hangover, I'd classify it as a ""mental"" hangover and not worth it at all. Just another reason to not touch the stuff.",t3_nyv659
753,3 Weeks today,"I'd just like to say first that I'm very grateful for this group, it has been an anchor during a turbulent time, which is really something I'd never have expected from a subreddit some weeks ago in all honesty.

Some of my thoughts having made the decision a few weeks ago after 20 years of denial and destruction. I found that not drinking was easier than denying I had a problem in the first place. So far at least. Having spent so many years saying 'I can moderate', when I finally saw the forest from the trees, that this just was not going to happen, a sense of clarity took over the urge to a large degree. Its been seeing me through thus far.

I'm from Ireland, so you can guess what that means for the social aspect. We've been in lockdown for practically almost a year, and only began opening up this week, with pubs offering outdoor service. Needless to say, the city has been rammed all week with people making the most of it and the good weather. Certainly a difficult time to quit drinking, considering most of my binge drinking was done socially (for the most part), but so far the urge hasn't overcome me. When I see the genpop out in droves living and drinking it up, I think back to only a matter of weeks ago when I would have loved nothing more than to spend a shit ton of money getting blackout drunk, not remembering what happened, and feeling like pressed garbage for days, subsequently eating like shit, not training, absconding responsibilities and living in regret and anxiety. And I think about how good it is not to be feeling any of that today. I'm just hoping I can keep reminding myself, because 3 weeks really isn't a long time, but already feels like a lifetime. I can finally say I'm a bit proud of myself that I was able to sit amongst people drinking last night and not indulge, and proud of everyone here and their stories that help keep me going. Coffee cheers to you all",t3_nytvyp
754,"First time poster and newbie in r/stopdrinking, who could really use some advice on how to.","Struggling with feelings of guilt, shame and regret after drinking, even if nothing bad happened at all. Ill lay in bed the entirety of the next day and just cry, miss my family, think about killing myself. Its bizarre. I really wish it wasnt like this, but Im guessing I just have a reaction to alcohol thats not good for me. I want to stop drinking altogether. 

Problem is Im in my early twenties, all my friends like to drink, and I wont push the blame over on them either because I know they would happily hang out with me without drinking. Im usually the one, most of the time actually, to initiate drinking while we hang out. 

I want to stop, but I cant. I hate myself for it. Im scared this is the beginning of a problem, but I convince myself its not. 

What should I do to try and combat this? I have some mental health issues and according to my shrink I need medications, but Im terrified Ill drink while on them and something bad will happen.

756,Sitting in a bed that reeks of vodka vomit. Humiliated by the things I texted and posted to Instagram. I hope this is my last day 1 ever.,"I have to reset my badge but I really need to get this off my chest. I’ve just had probably the worst 5 day bender in my life and the aftermath feels brutal. Been drunk since Monday, stopped last night. I vomited vodka on my bed and haven’t been able to change the sheets yet because it hurts to move. 
There is dried vomit all over the apartment. Haven’t changed my underwear since Tuesday. Passed out when I was supposed to go to a birthday party, and can’t find the courage to explain to the birthday woman why I just didn’t show up. 
I am covered head to toe in giant bruises that look like someone beat the shit out of me. I am terrified by the amount of alcohol I consume in one sitting. The apartment is a wreck and so gross. I know we take it one day at a time but words cannot express how badly I never want to be at day 1 again. 
I have no doubt alcohol is ruining my life. I know I’m an alcoholic but I just didn’t want to stop. 
My plan is to do 90 meetings in 90 days with the hope that it just becomes a thing I do without question. I know AA isn’t for everyone, but it was the one thing that kept me sober when I first started this journey. Not even a near fatal experience mixing alcohol and sleeping meds got me to stop. 
I don’t even pretend to like alcohol anymore. I literally just buy a bottle of vodka and chug it to black out. I am losing time, health and experiences to drink alone all day. I’m a 31 year old woman who should be enjoying life and instead I’m just poisoning myself. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore because I’m so sad at the person I see in front of me.

758,Couple of brushes with alcohol,"I recently had glimpses of a life with alcohol that helped remind me of what I'm managing to escape and to be grateful for my freedom.

Maybe this would normally be in our faces everyday but with lockdown perhaps it's more noticeable.

Number 1: A guy on the bus with a huge (3L) botlle of super strong white cider. He'd only just opened the bottle, sounded coherent when talking on the phone. But he still had a few gulps every minute or two. That was me a few years ago. The cider is cheap and WILL get you proper mashed up. It was about 11 in the morning.

Number 2: Walking through town on a hot, sunny day. About midday. A guy and his girlfriend on a park bench. He was horizontal they were having some conversation. I wondered if he was drunk and carried on walking. I came back about half hour later and he was out cold, still on the same bench as people literally looked down on him as they walked past. His girlfriend was dusting him down, he didn't even flinch. Again, that was me up until fairly recently.

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong to do this but I projected previous me onto both scenarios and felt that I already knew pretty much everything about how these two guys lived their day-to-day lives. I used to think alcohol was the star of the show and everything else takes a back seat, as long as I can get hammered, THAT's the entire point of my existence. Even when I deep down, really hated it; I still deep down, really loved it.

In summary- alcohol is rubbish. Turn your back, walk away and keep on walking.",t3_nyt2ey
759,Day 8. So happy that I made it through the weekend.," So happy that I made it through Friday and Saturday without having a drink. Those days have always been the days that I struggle with the most. Last week I ended up blacking out on Saturday after I started drinking at 9 am having breakfast with a friend in a cantina. That day I had a fight with my wife that I don't even remember to this day, posted a bunch of stupid things on Twitter. However, I've been in a shitty mood all week but that's also because I'm out of weed.  

This Friday a friend was celebrating her birthday and I went to the party with my wife. My wife is not much of a drinker and she wasn't feeling very good so we grab some coffee and chai before going to the party. I poured my chai on a thermos mug so people didn't know that I wasn't drinking alcohol. Using a mug while drinking alcohol, is very normal in my town. I live in the Sonora desert where temperatures rise up to 122 F in summer.   

So we arrive at the party and the hosts offered me a beer right away and I tell them that I wasn't drinking that night. To my surprise, they don't even flinch, they just continue with our conversation. The night went on and one of the things that stuck with me is that nobody in the party asked me why I wasn't drinking, they didn't notice or didn't care. I was very happy about that. Not having a drink in my hand on a party always makes me feel weird and anxious.

I realize that those feelings were a product of the environment that I usually hang out. All my best friends are heavy drinkers and if they see you not drinking you will be the butt of the jokes all night. We all are in our mid-30s so that behavior is a little ridiculous. Surely it makes me little sad that it will no longer hang out with them that much but it's just not worth it anymore.

761,Just got a 12 month Esperal Implant - Disulfiram/Antabuse.,"I’ve been drinking since I was 11. 
3 hospital visits, two years of 3 times weekly therapy, CBT/DBT,  4 months of rehab, a few meetings, 10k two week therapy in Thailand clinic AND 3 month Naltrexone Implant. 

I’ve also used Naltrex and Teturam pills daily. 

Nothings worked. I relapse every 3-5 weeks. Binge 9-16 drinks daily for a few days; quit college, jobs, cheat, burn best friend bridges and then crash into bed. Sober up for a while and rinse and repeat. 

So had my dad go to his government friends. Intense scrutiny. Two months of research and calls to Switzerland and EVERYWHERE. Ordered three options from Poland, Ukraine, France. Decided and had it implanted under my left shoulder blade an hour ago. 

1 year. 

Had to sign a waiver with a witness recognising if I break treatment I may experience death, blindness, paralysis, loss of both arms, aneurysm and a few more fun things. 

SO guess who has no choice but to not touch alcohol for a year. Me.

I told myself I’d have 2, the usual lie.

Basically my drinking is like rolling a dice on how bad it's going to get, I'll sit on my living room floor and drink until I pass or stagger back to the shop, I just cannot control it once I flip that switch, I've gone 5 days before of just waking up in a state on going straight back to shop for a 70cl of vodka to just carry on and I spent over the 5 days over 400£.

I dunno what to do about this situation, I know the obvious is just to not drink but it's easier said than done for sure I've gone 3 months without it before bit it always creeps up on me, its like something within me just knows its bender time and I'm just due that self sabotage.
It's very much not a social thing for me as I'm always on my own when I do it and tbh I don't really like being around people when I'm doing that because who wants to socialise when I can't even string a sentence together.

I've read up on a drug called Naltrexone so I'm gonna stop at nothing to get that as from what I've seen it really does help with my kind of drinking because I'm clearly getting some sort of added effects from drinking which is making me want to get so drunk, funnily enough I don't even like the taste of it I just want to be drunk when I Start. 

I'm writing this totally fed up and internally beaten its taking its toll and I feel like I'm loosing the fight, I've got a lovely girlfriend who is also at the end of her tether with it, she can see without alcohol I'm not a bad lad but she hates me when I'm drunk, I also hate drunk me also, I hope writing this will do something positive for me!",t3_nywj6l
766,Family altercation.,"Today was a productive day until my mom called me and told me my sister and brother in law got into an argument. I could tell my mom was livid from her tone. I told her to breathe and that I will meet her at my sisters house. I’ve been practicing grounding so I was able to relax and keep my blood pressure from rising and not jump to any conclusions. When I got there they were already leaving and they didn’t give me a chance to park. (They know me and him don’t get along too well) I guess they had been drinking and an argument broke out. She wanted to drive but we were able to convince her to park her car and just ride with us. We got her away from the situation safely. 
I am grateful that it didn’t escalate to a bigger problem. I am grateful that I was sober and able to help my family when they needed me. I’m grateful they are starting to count on me again, after years of being the black sheep. 
I was having thoughts that maybe I could moderate or “it wasn’t that bad” but the strong hug my sister gave me, the sigh of relief from my mom after we got home safely, remind me of what’s really important. Trust and dependability from those I love. Sending good vibes to all. IWNDWYT",t3_nyq0w3
767,"Not sure why Sunday is such a trigger day, but it is such a trigger day.","Sunday day drinking was a fun isolated occurrence for a long time. And as time went on it became more regular, I'd start early, feel like a zombie sooner and longer. 
I am posting this today as I had the thought to day drink later as I am doing my morning chores. 
By the end of typing this, my rational mind is laughing at this day drinking idea. Instead I'm going to go check out a garden with my family, take care of my house, go for a run, and LIVE a life. I'm not going to let alcohol live it for me.

769,One Year Still Here,"Hi team SD!

Made it. Things got rough lately, it's one month since my father died unexpectedly, and a few days since some close friends sober shamed me at a gathering.

So I don't have a 'top of the mountain' feeling today.

But with your help I've discovered that I can for real change my life. Change habits, change outlook, change behaviours.

And that's a huge gift. Getting unstuck. I didn't think people really did that.

I also have a handle on what self care is now. It's not just having a bath and doing what you feel like. It's keeping the basics going. Good food, good sleep, exercise, boundaries, healthy connections.

There's a lot of work still to do. I'm not as big on 'service' as I should be. I still take to my bed for the day when things get challenging. But it's all a process. Life, love, health, grief. All a process. If you do get to the top of the mountain, you take in the view and keep going. It's not always sunny.

Anyway. There it is. The one year post. Fucking Yes. 

And of course, thank you to everyone reading this. Chances are I've read your post back. Thank you for yours. It sure all helps. Thank you for being my recovery tool, SD. You're the best.",t3_nyrja7

But tonight we get home and I've been having cravings again. I'm worried once we get home I'm going to fall right back to square one. We have no alcohol in the house, we're going to be very tired from traveling, and frankly sleep sounds amazing more than anything, but I'm still worried I'm not going to be strong enough.",t3_nyvmer

I’m also lucky in that I have an amazing support team around me. 

Today, after an early night to bed, I awoke naturally with the sun to watch the sunrise. Unplanned, it just kinda happened. 

I know there’s some early bliss in getting sober. I know it won’t all be easy like it is today.  But I also know I’m not taking anything for granted any longer. I’m cherishing every moment.

775,Shape Up Sunday,"Welcome to a new week sobernauts! This is our weekly thread where we talk about how sobriety is helping us to move toward our fitness goals. (Or we vent that we're not seeming to make progress.) 

What I'm pleased about is that I've been hitting my 100k steps a week goal very consistently over the past few months. Full disclosure: not having a full time job makes it way easier. But for a long time I wondered if jobs were just an excuse and maybe even with more free time I wouldn't hit it, but I was right. Working at a desk job makes for a much bigger challenge at hitting the necessary +/- 14k a day to get 100k in a week. 

Last week I only got 84,000 steps but I'm still very pleased with that in light of the fact that I drove almost 2,000 miles that week. I made lots of time for going for walks while on my travels. 

So how about you guys? Any PRs or progress you want to share? How is sobriety helping your fitness goals lately? Or are you struggling and could use some good ol' fashioned SD support? Let's hear it, friends.

777,Relapse Siren Song,"Over 3 years ago, I quit drinking (yay!). 10 weeks ago, I quit smoking (yay?).

I feel like I’m newly sober all over again. Maybe worse? These last couple of months have been the first in 15 years that I haven’t had a self-destructive crutch. A warm, familiar, dirty cancer-riddled or liver-ruining blanket to cuddle with while we kick back and laugh at the latest episode of the never-ending stream of ‘Me Not *Really* Sorting My Shit Out’.  

My emotions are a complete wreck. I can barely identify how I’m feeling in the chaos (yet somehow simultaneously barren wasteland?) of my mind, let alone address the feelings and label and organise them into colour order (is that what you do with feelings?). 

I’ve spent much of the last few weeks doing laps in my thoughts and trying to make sense of who I even am - I’m exhausted. It’s so hard! And then today it happened. A  cheeky little voice at the back of my head addressed me, “Oi. Ya know what would be so easy to do right now? Ya know how you could get that relentless hamster wheel up there to stop turning? You know. It would feel like such. A. Deserved. Rest.” 

Now, I’m almost a pro at “not drinking” these days. So I won’t drink today. But I still feel small, vulnerable, and a little lost. Apparently there is still much work to do on the profound urge to self-destruct upon hitting a wall of emotional exhaustion. 

Not sure why I wrote this. Quick little vent? Validation? But if you read it, thank you for your time and have a lovely day 💕",t3_nyqn78

779,Yesterday was hard Mentally ❤️,"I woke up happy…Then started digging on Facebook,then got Angry and then left messages and texts to my Ex.
I’m so ashamed.

I called my “Best Friend” and told her what I had done and she told me that she had been getting loads of missed calls from a number that looks like his…She sent it to me…

I called the number and it was him.I started the conversation and asked him why he had been phoning my friend…He told me she had been calling him regularly and then told me loads of information about myself that only she would know.

I txt her about it and got no reply (she was probably drinking).Then she called and denied it.I trust neither of them…

I know this sounds pretty childish but it really has affected me.I’ve had my doubts about her for a long time.She is always getting into fights and trouble,and sticking her nose in..She only really calls when she wants money for fucking drink.
She is basically a nasty piece of work.

I started craving..So I bought a bottle of Diet Coke ,went round the corner to see my brother,smoked a joint,helped him decorate his room and listened to Hendrix and Pearl jam.His partner has taken my prices for Hair and said a few people have asked about me because they like the restyle I gave her.I might of picked up a little cleaning work too.

I left my Brothers and went shopping and stocked up on Tea,Coffee,sugar,milk and biscuits,then went back to my house share to chill in the garden.I txt my Naighbour to see if she was ok,she is in her 60’s and has been really quiet and not her feisty self lately,I told her I noticed we was running low so I stocked up and that there was a chicken salad for her in the fridge and she came out and we went for a cigarette in the Garden.We had a good chat in the garden and I told her what had happened….
Then she told me she has been ill again and is feeling worse than last time and was being sent for a biopsy on Monday…The conversation reminded me of the one I had with my Dad when he got ill..I gave her a hug,went upstairs and sat in silence.She is like a mother to me and everyone in the house.

I woke up this morning put Elton John Tiny Dancer on my earphones and Cried….But I stayed Sober.

I Need to fight this harder now,for my Dear friend,to fight for visitation to my son…But most important myself.

I’m going to txt my “Best friend” today and tell her I want space,and to wish her the best.
I’ve deleted all my ex’s numbers and messages….
And today I’m going to chill,listen to my tunes and meditate.

Fuck them.

783,"Help me keep on track for today, day 2!!!","Good morning good day good evening

Have been lurking this sub for a little while since someone recommended it to me, and I am now on day 2 of not drinking, feels great apart from the crippling anxiety and waking up at 4am this morn haha, but at least i got out of bed to see the sunrise rather than lying in my own filth watching the room spin! It would be great to have a bit of encouragement from you guys to keep it going today, I was meant to see a friend to keep me occupied but they couldn’t make it and now although i feel optimistic I also am a bit anxious about drinking again, which is making me think about drinking, and then that's making me more anxious and I don't want to drink but also I do! I feel kind of ashamed too that it's literally day 2 and I'm already having these thoughts. 

Backstory: bar January to end of march this year, I've basically been on a bender for the entire pandemic. I've had poor mental health for most of my adolescence/adult life; I don't really believe in 'hitting rock bottom' anymore because I've just been there so many times, have had problems with a few different drugs before, but never with alcohol to the extent that it’s been for the past year. 

A week ago was a bit of a wake up call. I got hammered on gin with a guy from my work. Early next morning I wake up to stickiness all over my face and pillow, and realise it's blood. I have no recollection of it whatsoever, but I later found out from the guy that i fell so hard to the ground that I split my chin open and bruised my jaw, damaged my knee, and scabbed up my knuckles. He thinks I probably passed out from it too. 

I’ve since been lurking here (still quietly, sadly, shamefully drinking) and researching different places I can go for help, and yesterday at last I didn’t drink anything. I’ve tried and failed to stop before, so this time I am stepping up my support system, told my therapist and a couple of really close friends and family, and if you guys can be a part of it I would be really grateful! Thank you for reading xo I will not drink with you today!",t3_nytpjt
784,Abstaining is so much easier than moderating,"I’ve done a pretty good job of moderating my drinking in the past but now that I’ve stopped completely (2 weeks today) I actually find it easier. When moderating, I thought about drinking most of the day, constantly negotiating with myself about allowing myself to drink and how much I could have, trying to justify one more and feeling sad if I didn’t let myself have it. Now I wake up every morning and make a decision not to drink and I’m pretty much done with it. Sure, I think about drinking here and there during the day but nothing like when I was moderating. Moderate drinking is mentally exhausting.",t3_ny8bkz
785,Some thoughts on Day 1,"It's taken me about about a year of reading quit lit books, therapy, journaling, lurking on this sub, and half-assed attempts at moderation but here I am - ready to commit to a sober life. Just a few thoughts I would like to get out:

1. Basically the ONLY obstacle in my life is alcohol. I am grateful to be a very fortunate person. My drinking has prevented me from reaching my potential in every aspect of my life, but I have everything else working in my favor.
2. I am the only person who can remove this obstacle.
3. I don't even have to do anything ... I just have to *not* do one thing.

I have not hit a public ""rock bottom"" yet, but I think I know in my heart that if I keep drinking, I will eventually. I also know that even if things never got worse than they are now, even if I just stayed drinking the same amount and frequency for the rest of my life, that's unacceptable. Just recently I got the shakes for the first time and called a crisis hotline because I felt subhuman and had suicidal ideations (i.e., didn't want to kill myself but didn't care if I died either). That wasn't public but it *was* a rock bottom. Also, my mother, who has the exact same drinking patterns as me, still binges sometimes. That's my future if I don't stop for good. No one outside the family knows about her continued drinking, but she is miserable and feels out of control of her life. 

And I do not think I am capable of moderation. What is the point of continuing to try? My mom has tried for 40 years and gotten no where. Ingesting alcohol flips a switch in me; my conscious mind turns off and I need more more more. Even if I *were* able to have just one drink every time, I would be inviting discomfort and craving into my life, and for what? To fit in? I've never minded beating to my own drum in other aspects of my life. I am continually reminding myself that sobriety is not a punishment, but rather an opportunity to become as conscious and present as I possibly can. And that's a pretty cool gift :)

I'm attending my first in-person Refuge Recovery meeting tomorrow, I'm going to re-read a quit lit book, and I'm going to start meditating again. I have a wedding in which I am part of the wedding party next weekend, but I am actually looking forward to proving to myself that I can have fun while sober. The three weddings I attended in my early 20's are some of my most shameful drinking memories. It will be cool to actually enjoy and remember this one :)

Thanks for listening guys. Mostly everyone in my life drinks either socially or heavily and doesn't really think I have a problem, and I am also a bit of an overthinker so it's nice to get it out of my head and out into the world. IWNDWYT!!!",t3_nyp59u

792,The end of day 15 and feeling like a judgemental bitch,"Well folks, I did it. Toasty warm in my bed at the end of another sober day. I posted earlier about cravings and justifications rearing their ugly heads this morning, but I have stuck to my guns, and the day did get markedly better! Take that ""this suffering will last forever"" thoughts. And a huge thank you to those who commented with support and advice.

However, a tendency of mine to be a judgemental bitch has also reared its head. I would like to vent, and this sub is really my safe space on reddit, and I think these feelings are related to my quitting frustration so the long ramble will likely circle back to that. Okay here it goes

Hello, my name is manicshoutout and im a judgemental bitch. I judge people over stupid things. I feel like people are deliberately being stupid when they dont react to situations as quickly as I do or in the way I think they should. I feel angry when other people blame their suffering on others and cant see that they are responsible for their own problems. And it makes me incredibly frustrated when someone seems content to live in the clutches of addiction and not make any effort to overcome it. 

I snapped at my mum today over not pausing netflix quickly enough when we realised we'd already seen that episode. What a ridiculous thing to get angry and judgemental about. It makes me angry every time my dad coughs because I know it's from smoking and he has no desire to stop.

I found the sub called crippling alcoholism today. (TW: dont go there if you are worried of stories about drinking triggering a relapse) And it made me... angry? Pitiful? Judgemental is probably the best word. How could these people be drinking themselves to death and not even want to change? 

All these things, written out, disgust me. Disgust me with myself. How can I have such little empathy? How can I be so self righteous? Am I without sin? What gives me the right to cast the first stone?

I think... I think the reason these things upset me so is because they are tendencies I see in myself. I was angry with my mum because she was startled when the show started playing too loudly and her brain stopped working for a second. Just like mine does at times. I'm frustrated with my dad because of my own struggle to stop smoking, and how I wanted to ignore the effects on my health. And the folks on CA? I guess that needs no explanation. I see my own deep tendency to want to get obliterated on alcohol, damn the consequences. 

I guess, in my effort to change my own behaviour, I've had to develop a judgement reaction to these thoughts in myself, and have projected that onto others. How could I not? I'm clearly holding myself to a higher standard, why not hold everyone else to it too? (That's my seriously out of control ego talking)

The truth is, I'm no different to any of the people I've mentioned. I'm not. I want to define myself in comparison to them, but that's just an idea, imagined and created by me, holding no accuracy or power over reality. I'm imperfect, I'm weak, I'm judgemental. And I need to be reminded of that, and forgive that in myself, so I can forgive others. Forgive might be the wrong word. Accept? Understand? Love? Maybe all of them.

All I know, is being judgemental hasn't brought me any happiness. There is no joy in feeling falsely superior or angry at everyone else's failings. But if I can bring love into my interactions with myself and the rest of the world? I think there might be joy in that.

Thank you, if you made it through my long rambling babble. I love you and IWNDWYT.",t3_nylc0c
793,My worsening black outs scared me straight,"Hi guys! Thanks for being such a supportive group.
I started having black outs about 2 years ago when I began taking anxiety and depression meds and mixed these with alcohol. I was also steadily drinking more at this time. I would have zero memory after a certain point in the night and would also say really weird things, especially if I fell asleep on the couch and got woken up, usually by my boyfriend. I would usually say a bunch of gibberish, which he would tell me about the next day and we would cringe and laugh about it. I always carried a lot of guilt and shame for this. 

One night I fell asleep on the couch next to my bf after drinking too much and woke up, although I was blacked out, turned my head to him and told him I would kill him THEN slit his throat. My eyes were wide open and I was looking at him as I said this. I eventually came to and just went upstairs and went to sleep. No recollection of this the next day when he told me about it and I was absolutely mortified. He thought it was kinda funny, but was mainly concerned at what clearly was becoming a problem—my drinking. 

Flash forward a few months later, which is now a few weeks ago, and the same thing happened. This time, I’m asleep on the couch after having my usual excessive amount of wine, I sit up next to my boyfriend, in a black out state, and I start running my finger up and down his back saying how he was going to die, very slowly. He said I put an emphasis on the fact his death would be a slow one. Again, eyes wide open looking right at him. Totally weirded out, he gets up and walks into the kitchen. I follow him in and he gets even more freaked out because now I’m standing next to a couple of very large kitchen knives and basically talking gibberish. At this point I actually remember coming to and find myself standing with him in the kitchen. I gave him a hug and he told me to go to bed, so I did. He said he was on edge all night. I don’t blame him.

When my boyfriend told me all of this the next morning, while I have a pounding headache and feel awful anyway, I just wanted to wither away. I felt so awful for doing that to him. I took a long walk and cried my eyes out. I felt shattered. I just couldn’t believe what alcohol was doing to me. That person wasn’t me! Alcohol was turning me into a monster. 

Black outs are no joke and they only get worse. To think that I put myself in a state where I’m capable of saying and maybe even doing things I would never even imagine while sober sickens and scares me. I think we often laugh them off, until they are not funny anymore.
One good thing that came out of these awful incidences is I’ve taken a much harder stance over how much I drink, which should be zero. I haven’t been perfect with how much I drink since then, but I’ve cut down substantially and am working my way towards being free of this stuff completely. 

I don’t know what my rock bottom is, but if it’s anything like this, I don’t want to go there. Good thing I’m waking up now and (trying) to not let the worse happen.",t3_nylrua
794,Tips on long-term recovery,"I posted yesterday for my Day 1. Now in Day 2 and still feeling a little woozy and sorry for myself. I'm exploring all the different types of long-term recovery and I was hoping you would be able to provide some insight into one or all of these:

- Medication - I'm hoping to see a doctor some time this week. Apparently, two of the meds they often prescribe is Naltrexone or Acamprosate. Does anyone have any experience with these?

- AA - I tried AA a few years ago, but the 'higher power' didn't really call to me. As in, I never really understood it. But has it worked for anyone else? (Preferably secular)

- Counselling - I've consulted a therapist for help with this on top of whatever help I could get from the first two. There are obvious costs associated with this, but I can handle that by saying I'm no longer spending any money on the sauce. This would be the more personal option for me and they would be a greater opportunity to talk through the problems.

- Rehab - I don't really have time to take two weeks off to attend a facility, but I'm exploring every option right now.

Any other tips would help me a great deal. Thank you!",t3_nys7i5
795,A normal sober Saturday night,"Just thought id share, but this is a little dull. But ya know, a dull (And calm/happy) Saturday night is nice to share. After having generated too many drunk stories. In a nutshell... I started young (England, when i was 16), it was kinda normal. Drank until i was 38, then quit. I was a happy but clumsy drunk. Plenty of ER stories there. Realized that i drank because i liked the gentle (then full on) fuzzy and numbing feeling. I was never bothered about the taste. Just decided i didn't want to be the mummy that needs wine/beer, or just a drink in her hand. Fast forward 4 years.. Im sitting here tonight reading, by an open window. One kid is chilling in her room. Other kid has friends round for a sleep over. Im fine. I feel fine. I feel calm. I feel nice. it's been a tough few days. I don't want to drink.

798,One week!,"It's been a week since I've last drank. Last weekend forced me to reassess my relationship with alcohol and decide to stop completely.

Long story short last weekend I got drunk, blacked out, broke my ankle on my walk home and then attempted to hurt myself in various ways once I had gotten to my house.

I usually don't drink often but when I do, I binge. Lately I've noticed it's been getting to the point of drinking every weekend. I don't necessarily like it (hangovers, making a fool of myself at the bar, etc.) But for whatever reason that never seems to stop me from doing it again. Now I feel as if I have the confidence and power to actually stick with it.

800,"Theres the pain of discipline, and theres the pain of regret","Today, i chose the pain of discipline. IWNDWYT. 

What a wild fucking ride. My last couple of relationships have ended because of my alcohol drinking problem. Been to the hospital. Got a DUI and spent last Christmas in jail (all in the same year) Now im fighting that legal battle while at the same time trying to become a citizen. Ive lost friends i never thought or wish i would. And ive learned whos still there for e when im rock bottom. I have a great job paying me well but ill day drink my day away, some how be functional and very social. Not remembering what conversation Ive had with whoever at work. Ive been so scared to lose my job but my boss is so supportive. All though he doesnt really know whats going on with me. So many sleepless nights waking up sweating. So many anxious days. So many hours crying in my room on my own. Im scared to lose my health. My friends. My life. Im scared to hurt people close to me because i go from that fun drunk to a careless piece of shit. 

Every. Single. Bad thing that has happened in my life ive been wasted. 

Im 2 days sober I havent done that in over a month. I dont think ive gone longer than 5 days without drinking this year. I just flew to another state to see my family and celebrate my dads and sisters birthday. Im here for two weeks and im hoping i can use this change of scenery to break my addiction. Im craving a drink. I feel easily annoyed and frustrated. Even though im with the most loving family. 

I just looked up the liquor laws in the state im in and they are more flexible. They are open for the next hour and a half. 

Theres the pain of discipline, and theres the pain of regret. Tonight i will continue to suffer. But it will be the pain of discipline. Not of regret.

801,2 Months Sober and my hyperthyroid is back to normal!,"I quit drinking 100% two months ago, my thyroid had been getting worse and I was diagnosed with hyperthyroid. In case anyone does not know a hyperthyroid totally sucks, my hair was falling out, I was having night sweats, constantly hot or cold, anxiety through the roof with panic attacks, my period was two weeks long, my stomach hurt constantly , fatigued. After two months of not drinking my thyroid is NORMAL, it’s not in “ideal” levels but heck, my anxiety is almost gone, I’m a way better mom, I even went running last week! I wasn’t even a “heavy” drinker by any means... BUT a bottle or two of wine a week can apparently wreck your hormones! thanks to everyone on this sub who genuinely helped me let go of the “couple glasses to relax” mentality, and dive in to sobriety 200%.

802,"Sobriety is lonely, but not for the reasons you might expect at first.","I had a drunk dream a few nights ago. I was in a rail yard on a rainy night, naked and freezing and clutching an empty vodka bottle to my chest like a teddy bear. I forgot my own name. I forgot how to speak. I forgot my native language.

I was a drunk, mute John Doe. That's a lonely feeling, to be rock bottom, anonymous, and completely at the mercy of others who see you as not much more than a problem to be shoved out of sight.

In my waking life, I've been somewhat fortunate: I haven't lost friends to sobriety, though many of my friendships were strained to the breaking point by my flailing about trying to find some kind of equilibrium. One such friendship will never be the same again; my actions and words have had consequences that I'm ready to accept. The harder part is to stop flagellating myself for my post-sobriety stumbling.

I'm on a mission in interstellar space, light-years away from anything more than dust and echoes, and I just severed my umbilical and let go of the ship. I'll drift alone out here with only my breathing and the low hum of the suit's coolant pumps to keep me company. Today, I started to embrace that fact.

Sobriety isn't lonely of itself; in my experience, that feeling is just your waking up to the loneliness that's been there all along. I've in the long, slow climb back to sanity for 202 days. In a call with a fellow AA member earlier today, I finally understood the meaning of ""one day at a time"". The future is overwhelming and terrifying when viewed as an unbroken mass; tomorrow doesn't necessarily have to be, and I have so many tomorrows ahead of me.

How many of you are taking Naltrexone and do not drink? Is it there to be a security blanket or what? I have a 30 day rx and I am wondering if I just need to take it when I might be triggered or just stay on it as a prophylactic measure.

805,Day eight,"Met my girlfriend yesterday.

We went shopping and had lunch together. She was surprised I was only drinking water.

I remember how I used to take her out for dinner to some classy restaurant and she would be so happy about it. What a caring man she thought she had.

What she didn't know is that I only did so to have a good excuse to gobble my bottle of bordeaux without her objecting. And after I took her home I would stop at the bar to finish the job.

She wasn't unsuspecting, mind you. But I always found a way to fool her.

""Of course I'm not an alcoholic, honey. I'm a wine connoisseur"".

No more lies.

She's quite busy these days. Going through a delicate moment with her job. I would normally have said: ""Look, when all this is over we'll go eat something delicious in this or that new place in town"". This time around I promised I would take her hiking.

810,⚠️ Long post! I hope I my story will reach someone in need but also I hope by sharing my story I can make some new friends to help keep me on my sober journey 😊,"Soooo, I haven’t posted in a while and before that I think I only posted twice. Both times i was drunk and looking for a way out of my emotional chaos and possibly to feel less alone in my habit. However the next day I’d wake up and think “oh wow what a drunk idiot” and just move on in the day. It makes me sad because I really did relate to everyone’s stories and felt comfort in everyone’s words of encouragement but I wasn’t ready to not drink with you today. I wanted to continue it for whatever reason because sober me didn’t want to believe I was an alcoholic. I felt so much shame and frustration that if I admitted it, it meant I needed to stop for good. Well it took a 4 day weekend binge of almost nothing to eat or drink except beer and whiskey for me to realize the alcohol wasn’t doing it’s job, my issues were in full blown reveal and I couldn’t take it anymore. I drunkingly (not a word apparently) called everyone I know, a few rehabs (desperate for help) and finally my sister who has been wanting me to get help. I knew if I called her she’d come. I was right. She picked me up, I was wasted. Drove me 2 hours back to her house and put me to bed. I woke up with an awful anxiety ridden hangover and didn’t know where I was. I scrabbled to find my phone and couldn’t. I knew I was at my sisters, I searched for alcohol(6am) to get rid of this feeling like I normally do and nothing. Long story short they “tortured” me by not letting me drink, taking my purse and my phone. I was a disaster, screaming at them and begging for beer or the hospital or both! It was then I knew...I didn’t just have a problem...I was an undeniable ALCOHOLIC. I talked to many people from AA and they knew exactly how I felt but that didn’t take away the pain of the withdrawals (they were BAD) I finally went to the hospital and I’ve NEVER felt like that before I was shaking and terrified. I stayed in the hospital for two days...it was a humbling experience because no one judged me they all just wanted to help. The outpouring support has been overwhelming. I went to my first AA meeting the day I got out and wow was that emotionally draining in the best way. I have a sponsor now and she’s amazing I’ve lost my voice with how much I’m just spilling my guys and no longer lying and hiding from my addiction. It’s so freeing and I took 6 weeks off (told my boss) and I’m going to rehabilitate myself with my new AA family (I already love them). I’m now 4 days sober and feeling better. I’m still on my withdrawal medication and still reeling from it. Insomnia is real and frustrating but I’m being productive during it lol talking to all of you. This is a long post but I just wanted to share my story. There’s hope for me and I’m excited to get my life back and no longer be controlled by alcohol. So I hope whoever is out there struggling reads this and knows they’re not alone and if you can just check out a meeting! You won’t regret it!",t3_nytf69
811,Update: My best friend has passed away. I am 1 week sober.,"I've been back on here time and time again, trying to go from a person that drank heavily every single day to a regular person. My last post I was 6 days sober and feeling great a lot has happened from then until now.   


Overall I approved my life but I'm still struggling. I was making great progress. Sure, sometimes I would slip up  but rather than sit in my guilt I would just get over it and keep things moving. This was working for me things were changing. I was even helping other people with their sobriety.   


One of those people was a good friend of mine. My friend for over 25 years (I'm 31 years old). He lost his life to addiction and that set me off. I thought losing my grandmother was bad, but losing one of your best pals is like losing a piece of your identity. It felt like I died. I can't explain it.   


Anyway, it's been a little over two months and I'm done feeling bad for myself.  I've never been so focused on sobriety in my entire life. It's a Saturday night at 10PM and I'm sitting at home and I don't feel like I'm missing anything.  I even turned down my other best friend's birthday this week! Got beer in the fridge, haven't touched it. Got a keg in client's offices, haven't drank it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only temptation I truly had/have is with my agoraphobia. Had it my whole life but the last 3 years has been next to impossible. Whenever I need to travel somewhere I debate on if I should drink before hand because the panic attacks can be massive and very embarrassing. I'll talk about that more in another post.   


My goal right now is to stay sober until July 3rd. I'm not going back to drinking but I have a cocktail event that I've been looking forward to for like 6 months so I'll probably do that and brunch the next day. Then get back on the wagon for another month or maybe longer. I'm also seeing the doctors around that time so I will know what damage my drinking has done over the years and even if I could physically continue. More about that in another post.

813,Father from my past came into my life again,"Hi all,

Some emotional things are happening making me want to drink.

When I (47F) was about age 11 a father of a convent near me sexually crossed the lines with me. I thought I was over it since I had therapy until a few weeks ago this same father came to my parent's house to ask money for his convent. Not knowing what happened, my father and stepmother gave him the money. The father asked about me and my sister, looked at photos from me,.. all details from my life I don't want to share with him. 

I am really upset by this. If I don't take action, this father will come every year asking for money, which he will be given. 

I contacted an organisation that mediates between victims and perpetrators, I hope they can help me. 

It all makes me want to drink. I just want to forget.

I am exercising more because I have the energy. But still eating a fair amount of candy. 

My anxiety is much less so that's a nice bonus.

819,"I won an award at work, then decided to celebrate. Bad decision.","After going close to 60 days fully sober, alcohol has slowly crept back into my life as of late. Started with a few beers while watching the NHL playoffs with a buddy (this happened on two nights.... our team is on a rare run to the final four so hey, what the hell?). I didn't get drunk either of those times, so of course I pushed the limits, and last weekend I got drunk for the first time since March. I didn't blackout or do anything I regret, but I was mildly hungover and unmotivated at work the next day. But it wasn't enough to make me regret drinking.

Flash forward to Thursday night. Work party, state-wide annual awards ceremony. I knew before it even started that I was going to get loaded. So I just leaned into it. And when I won a personal award for my work my fate was set. After the ceremony a bunch of us went to a bar to keep the good times going, and it was actually a really fun time. I think that's what's making this harder for me. I don't regret the act itself, because it felt earned and we all let loose together.

But holy shit. The hangover was pure death. When i got home I fell over twice (I think... I only remember one of them—in which I crashed into my protruding bed frame and the wall register, leaving it dented and myself in extreme pain—but I've got enough bruises to tell me I fell at least one other time). The toilet and the floor around it were covered in puke when i woke up. My aim wasn't great.

Needless to say, I was absolutely useless all day on Friday, so i just gave myself the day off to rest up and deal with my hangxiety. It hasn't fully gone away yet, either. I just feel this overwhelming sense of shame and embarrassment, even though I know I didn't do anything that embarrassing or shameful. I suppose the worst part is knowing all that life-affirming progress I bragged about in a past post is just gone. Back to square one, again.

I've reset my counter, and I don't plan on drinking again anytime soon. But I can't say I won't, either, after the way things have gone the past month. I guess I just need to let some of this out, if only to hold myself accountable. But the depression is still there. The anxiety. The shame. Feelings of absolute worthlessness, hopelessness. I don't want to see anybody, I don't want to admit how I'm feeling to the people in my life. So I'm telling you, and hoping I can find my mental footing tomorrow.",t3_nyofsn

Seeing people on patios having drinks, behaving like normal people, I felt so jealous I convinced myself I could do that too. I started to slip slowly, having drinks with friends  or a couple beers at a restaurant and evolved into sneaking wine into the house, chugging from the bottle in the bedroom and trying to act sober. Alcohol makes me angry, I'm a mean drunk and it was a hard not to pick fights during these times.Yesterday I decided to get a bottle of wine after work. I immediately picked a fight with my boyfriend and it snowballed into me screaming until late into the night. He's at the end of rope with me, I'm humiliated and terrified of running into the neighbours. I can't believe I've done this again. I'm tired of hurting people, I'm just so tired of it.

2 nights ago I went with one of my best friends and my number one drinking buddy to see a live band at a Brewery. I think I was the only one there not drinking. I watched by friend drink 8 IPA's and I would have been right there with him. I paid attention to how it changed him over the course of the night. Watching his speach begin to slur, get emotional, stumble to get more beer. By the end of the night he couldn't walk straight and almost fell. That would have been me too. I also watched people around me getting drunk. Luckily, It really doesn't bother me to do these events because I already made the choice to live alcohol free and it was my decision. I guess I finally got tired of my own shit. 

I enjoyed the out door live music, enjoyed the company of my friend, enjoyed being able to drive home sober, woke up hangover free.

835,Scared,"Been killing a bottle of wine near every night of the last six months. Trying to quit today but I’m scared of the withdrawal. Is there anyone who has drank at the same level that can share some tips. DT sounds horrible and I’m wondering if i should check myself in to the hospital or if it’s safe for me to stay at home. Thanks guys.

Update. 
It’s been 2 and a half days and i feel a little better. I think i was just scaring myself with reading other posts. I naturally have anxiety so that doesn’t help much. The only thing i really experienced was shakes and panic attacks the first day. The main thing now is the inability to sleep. Over the last couple days I’ve slept a total of about 5 hours. Any tricks to help sleep or is this now just a waiting game.",t3_nyobxo
836,"I mentally cannot quit, anyone replace with herb?","So, I’ve cut out caffeine and weed for over 1.5 months now thinking it would help to get down to one substance (alcohol) then quit that. Without everything else interfering. The main reason I drink is for the relaxing effects of GABA on my overactive brain. Even on days which I feel good I still end up drinking though. I essentially need my “fix” of something at the end of each day. 

I’m starting to consider an attempt to introduce weed again and drop the alcohol. Has anyone else done this successfully? I’ve heard people say “your replacing a substance with a substance” but it’s a lesser of two evils for my health by far.",t3_nyo6qb
837,Day 168 - I just had to post how wonderful my escape has been so far,"Day 168 after my escape from a pretty nasty alcohol addiction for more years than I can remember. It's not really a specific milestone, but I just felt the need to describe how remarkebly easy and wonderful my escape has been. Somehow I really started to see through the facade and instead of the struggle it always was to quit drinking, having me relapse week after week again, 168 days ago it was in a strange way one of the greatest pleasures I've had in my life. Let me explain.

I started drinking for stupid reasons, as I'm sure we all do. One of these reasons was to use it as a sleeping aid. Because alcohol numbed me physically and mentally I was able to block certain challenging and confronting issues from my life temporarily. I was able to fall asleep faster because I became drunk, but I was also able to block certain emotional things too. The more I felt myself sliding down, the more I felt trapped in my downwards spiral. The lies kept piling up, the missed opportunities, the debt, the healthscares, the pain I've caused my family and friends, it was a nightmare world filled with dark shadows and I've never felt weaker and more alone in my life.

I don't know what it was that caused it. Somehow I started to really think about my reasons for drinking. Little by little it became obvious to me that I was looking at it from the wrong perspective. At first I saw my addiction as a habit that got out control and that I was now so used to that I had trouble to quit. I now see that I was wrong. I was never in control, the game was rigged from the start and all the things it destroyed in my life is exactly the reason why I couldn't escape it in the first place. Alcohol never changes, and neither does the addiction. There is nothing complicated about it, remove the contradictions and it becomes simplicity itself.

Drinking alcohol makes my life miserable and the only sensible and honest way to escape would be to see it for what it actually is: a poison that negatively impacts every aspect of my life, never gave me anything but a temporary numbing of mental and physical discomforts and therefore ensuring that I would never find the true cause of my unhappines.",t3_nyhra3

840,It’s clear now. I need to stop.,"I think this sub is filled with a lot of folks like me. We don’t think we are alcoholics and we don’t think we need help. After all, we only drink on weekends so we can’t be alcoholics, right? 

A couple of days ago I saw the biggest red flag, but like a complete moron, didn’t notice the dangers in it. I looked forward to Friday so I could drink. I didn’t look forward to me graduating with a Master of Arts degree or being able to meet my whole family. No, I only saw the booze in front me. 

I am 26, unemployed, and live with my dad. Nothing goes my way, and it hasn’t done the last few years. Yet I keep on ruining my weekends with alcohol.

Yesterday was supposed to be fun. Instead I spiraled deep down into the person I hate the most, my drunk self, and made a fool out of myself once more. Thinking back, every single mishap or bad time I can remember involves me drinking too much.

Yesterday was it. I’m fucking done. I was sober last fall but thought a few drinks over Christmas couldn’t hurt. And like every time, that mindset fucks me up once more. I wanna go back to last fall once more and hit myself in the nads just to reminds me what the fuck I am thinking.

I thought I had it under control. I thought I could drink responsibly. I can’t.

841,I'm gonna check in every day until I hit a week.,"One Week Down! 

I really want to thank everyone for your kindness and support.  I truly would not have accomplished this without this sub and all of your encouragement. 

I had some very personal highs and lows this week,  events that easily justified drinking in the past:  my wife got a promotion, time to celebrate!  I had to council an employee, drink away the stress.  Instead, I found better ways to celebrate (ice cream) and healthier methods for dealing with stress (walking/hiking).

Checking in here every day was exactly the kind of accountability I needed.  You all were so great, I couldn't bear to let you down.

This week of sobriety has shown me just how much damage I've done to my body, but I can feel it healing.  My sleep is slowly returning,  my bowels are normalizing, and I've even lost 2.5 pounds without trying. It's still going to take time to feel 'normal ' again, but the progress is encouraging. 

One final thought...I still can't wrap my brain around the thought of never drinking again.  When I think about forever it freaks me out. So much of my personality and social circle was tied to drinking that I'm not yet sure how its going to look going forward, but I do know this:

I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!",t3_ny9r70
842,5 days sober and feeling happy,"I recently quit drinking after my third alcohol related arrest. I’m 28 and have been a hard drinker for 9 years now, I’d say chronic in the past 3. I’ve had pancreatitis twice as well, and other health problems such as tooth decay (also related to my smoking)

Being such a hard drinker, I told myself taking a night off or two every couple weeks was enough to keep me out of hospital. Well, it never was but I got popped before I had to go back anyway

I do intend on remaining sober but my question is this, will this light happy feeling go away? I mean I get the cravings bad like I did totday, but tonight I feel really happy. Is it an illusion, like is this normal when you first quit?",t3_nypkuq
843,Need to give up drinking,"I know I need to stop, at least for some time.

I have an awesome group of friends but they love to drink/drinking is involved in a lot of our social gatherings. I know that they’ll be supportive and totally respect my decision but how do y’all handle other social situations where people ask you or maybe pressure you to have a beer? Or at networking events?

I'm tired of the pattern and I'm tired of hating myself. I went for a run in the woods and after 4 miles, sweaty and breathing deep, I said out loud ""I want to die"". I think that's a thought I hold a lot that I try to push away through various means.

850,My world came crashing down 7 days ago…,"My world came crashing down 7 days ago. And through the guilt, shame, grief, embarrassment and anger at myself that I felt over the next couple of days I realized something - without alcohol what happened would not have happened. It was the alcohol inside of me acting out. I realized right then that I’m an alcoholic. I’d been drinking every day for years, up to half bottle of bourbon a night. I’d been an alcoholic for years, just didn’t accept it. Hiding it from everyone. And it was just getting worse. I knew right then I could never drink again. I realized with alcohol I have no control and cannot drink safely. I realized with alcohol everything in my life is in danger. Once I accepted that I was an alcoholic all I wanted was to get better, to get help.  I started sharing with people.  I wanted to do everything I could to ensure I never drink again, so I figured if my family knew and my close friends, that would help.  So I told my wife. I sent a long email to my parents and brother. I called them. Each day I texted a couple close friends.  The story was the same each time - I messed up, I’ve been battling depression and I’m an alcoholic, I’ve started counselling, I’ve quit drinking completely and I’m hoping to meet up with you soon when I’m feeling better.  That’s all I said.  And the responses back were amazing.  The support and encouragement and love  shocked me and has helped my healing and sobriety tremendously. 

So today, is day 7 of being an admitted alcoholic and of being sober.  If I drink again, I put everyone I love in danger, so I am doing everything I can to never drink again.  And being here, part of this community, is a positive step in that direction. This community is amazing.  

Thank you everyone for listening and for all your posts and sharing your own stories.  

Together we can all beat the iron grip that alcohol has placed within us.",t3_ny7cs7
851,Day 1 (again),"Same old, same old. But every new attempt is another step. What have I learned this time? Days 3-4 are hard for me. I will ask my husband to not have alcohol in the house for that period. Social events with free booze are hard for me to resist. I will not go to one without my own NA drink to hand.

And to re-hype myself, I am considering the questions posed by the alcohol experiment once again:

Why do I drink? What do I want that I THINK that alcohol can provide? 

I want to relax
I want to be more social
I want to get through my work more easily
I want to worry less
I want to be happier 
I want to enjoy myself more
I want to carry out a habit
I want to have something to occupy myself or my hands
I want things to be less boring
I want to recapture exciting nights out and fun times from university
I want to make myself more interesting

Over the coming weeks, I will examine each of these desires and figure out if alcohol does help, or if it is lying to me. I will find alternative methods and design back up plans for each want, so I can fulfill them in a satisfying and sustainable way. 

Now, why do I want to STOP drinking? What negative impacts do I observe or envision happening if I continue? 

When I drink, I feel bad about myself. It brings up feelings of guilt and shame that I cannot deal with in a healthy way in that state. I seek attention to try to feel better about myself, and when I do that, I hurt my husband and our relationship. I also further degrade my sense of self worth. I do bad things that I regret.
I do not want my relationship with my husband to be centered around alcohol. I want to know we have a solid foundation and can hang out together without it.
I do not want our children to grow up with parents who normalize drinking a lot.
I want to stay healthy and maintain a healthy weight. Alcohol damages my brain and my long term prospects. I do not need the empty sugar and calories that it brings.
If I reduce my drinking, my husband may also reduce his. This could reduce his risk of illness or even early death.
The money I do not spend on alcohol can be spent on things that bring lasting joy.
I want to be able to remember everything I did on a night.
I don't want to lose time and feel miserable during a hangover.
I want to see if my skin and eyes clear up.
I don't want to get red wine on me or other things.

And, if I stopped drinking, what would the future look like? 

In the future, I go to therapy and address the issues I have without masking them with alcohol. It is hard but I actually make progress. I don't stop feeling guilty for what I have done, but I don't worry about doing it again. 
I spend time with my husband having fun. Sometimes I have alcohol. Normally I don't. We have fun either way. 
I never wake up worrying about last night, and I don't worry my husband. I still enjoy all the activities I used to, just with a different drink. 
I have maintained a healthy weight with no bloating or hangovers - I feel healthy in mind and body. 
My children never expect me to have a drink or have been drinking.
I can socialize without drinking. It is hard and I have to make an effort, but I do not worry about slowly deteriorating and doing or saying something stupid.",t3_nym33f

853,Scared for the future. I need to change. I need to commit.,"I drank last night, passed out early, woke up to a note saying that she’s over it.

I am at a loss. I do not find joy in anything right now. My drinking has caused me to do so many stupid, hurtful, and humiliating things. I use to just numb myself and try to forget about all of my responsibilities. I’m 35 and have went thru this exact same scenario before. My ex left for the same reason. I quit drinking once before for a year or two, but it cost me my job and I got two DUIs. That was around 8 years ago. I’ve managed to NOT repeat those mistakes, but I am recognizing that I am not addressing my problems. I don’t want to go down this road again, I am doing better than I was the first time I hit rock bottom.

It seems like that dark past or demon is getting close again.

I can’t lose this relationship, she is a great person. I cannot continue to hurt her and myself like this.

I recently left a “prestigious job due to burnout and being super demanding. I’ve switched to a government job with a pension in an effort to look out for myself, but the culture and ways of doing things make no practical sense and causing me stress as well.

It’s just all too much.

I promised I would change but I never follow through. Life gets busy again and all seems ok.... until it isn’t, and here we are.

Here is what I’ve done today:

Called old friends back home (across the country) to say I need help. One friend is helping me to come up with a plan. I am breaking down right now knowing that friend was willing to listen to my nonsense and help guide me along. It’s been years since ive seen them and I haven’t always been a good friend.

I also contacted a therapist and am working to schedule an appointment.

I’ve called a local 800 number for alcohol addition and they gave me a number to call for free counselling. They are currently closed until Monday.

I’ve been to AA meetings  and it didn’t work out. Ive been to a psychiatrist before from the first break up from alcohol and on meds. It wasn’t the answer.

I don’t know what else I can do. I can’t do this by myself anymore. With bills to pay it creates more pressure.

This is the hardest thing. Why do I keep drinking and doing this to myself and the people I love?

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read.

854,I think its time to stop.,"23 M here. I got a DUI 2 years back and dropped out of college because of it. I started working a full time job and, while it provided me with a sense of pride, I'd always look forward to the weekends so I could get drunk on my own while playing video games. This in itself wasn't problematic to me, but then COVID happened and I lost my job. Went back to school and lived in a frat setting this past year which gave me permission to drink as much as I wanted, whenever I wanted it. I had many hungover mornings, one in particular where I threw up 15 times and swore I'd never drink again. Yesterday I went to trader Jo's and stood in front of the alcohol section for an uncomfortably long period of time, internally debating whether or not I should buy something. I left with a six pack and a fifth of vodka. Around nine PM I went and looked in my fridge and decided to have one beer. After the beer, the concept of ""one"" went out the window and I drained half the vodka. Got very drunk all by myself... something I swore I'd never do.",t3_nyk22g
855,Day 3 (again),"Wrapping up day 3 and so grateful for another day sober. I slipped a couple times since starting my journey on 5/5. This time around counting days, I feel different. I have a good amount of positive sober experiences under my belt and the gravity of my disease is more apparent to me. I am seeing how much is really at stake when I make the decision to have the first drink. I am taking accountability for the ways I have hurt those around me when I make the decision to drink. And the obviousness of the change in what the experience of drinking has become as a result of my disease’s progression. Gone are the days of a couple of social drinks and a pleasant buzz. That is no longer my reality. The progression of my addiction has morphed my drinking into a self-destructive cycle that begins with me searching for a feeling or experience I won’t find or if I do, won’t last long enough, and urges me to keep drinking-searching and digging until I do or say something I regret and then I pass out. Or if I can’t drink more, total frustration that I haven’t had enough—it’s like alcoholic blue balls. This is followed by waking at 3 am with a headache, dry mouth, and awful regret and anxiety. The voice in my head urging me to have just one is trying to sell me an illusion; I won’t have just one and I won’t have any kind of magical buzz or change into some ultra entertaining and interesting, glamorous party person. No. I will be on a mission to find something that isn’t even real and end up each time with sickness and regret. This is why IWNDWYT and it’s an easy choice tonight.",t3_nynrcf
856,Nightmare Relapse After 6 Years Sober,"Feeling very broken.  

After posting and following all of the amazing supportive vibes here and contributing when I can,  I fell down.  I really had to force my way into this,  there were many times for me to back out or just stop for the night.  I couldn't.  I hate to make excuses but after getting my vaccine recently I felt a lot of internalized energy that needed to be released.  

After 6 years without a drop of alcohol,  I had shattered all of that healing in a matter of hours.  Waking up in jail was such a reality check that I cannot drink.  Not socially,  not ever.

My night started with buying two small bottles of hard alcohol.  I bought drugs also and was consuming those but the paranoia from the drugs came on hard.  There is the, so called saviour alcohol to battle this,  make me feel all warm and fuzzy,  invincible again, against anything.  I put the drugs away and went on to a few pubs to keep drinking.  The quantity of alcohol added up fast and due to COVID closing all the pubs early,  I was left in front of a liquor store with another large bottle of alcohol.  Looking for more drugs. I remember a bird shit on me when I was walking,  this was not a sign of good luck to come. 

Sadly I bought unregulated street drugs and combined with a large bottle of alcohol,  I had a complete brown out. 

I came to in jail with cuts, abrasions and bruises all over me.  I can still feel the powerful drugs and alcohol blocking all the pain but the swelling made me very afraid.  What had I said? What had I done?  I will never know because the officer who arrested me was not there in the morning when I was released.

I cannot look at myself in the mirror and I'm sorry for all the details but I have no one I feel comfortable sharing this with now.  Reddit is and has always been a lifeline for an introverted alcoholic like me. I don't know the full weight of the fallout from this yet but anyone reading who is like me,  please don't trust yourself to socially drink.  The consequences can be life changing.

863,Back to Day Zero after 9 months and 2 weeks alcohol free.,"Just over nine months ago, I was free.

I have struggled with alcohol throughout my adolescent and adult life, and anyone who knows me knows that I have what could charitably be called a problematic relationship with the booze.

I was feeling isolated with coronavirus raging around me and drinking more than I ever had before. Which, if you know me, is a lot. I woke up after a night of binge-watching shit television while drunk feeling depressed and awful, so I bought and read a book about drinking and the psychology of drinking. My eyes were suddenly opened. There was an entire process dedicated to helping me move on from my addiction, and after so many false starts, so many wasted nights, and so many fights with myself in the alcohol aisle of the store, I finally broke my cycle.

My first days as a non-drinker were joyful. I was so happy to have left it all behind. Indeed, for months and months, I had no desire to drink at all. Life was just too beautiful, I was building too much, and enjoying too much to even think about letting booze get in the way of this vibrant, colorful existence that I had created. The months rolled on and I imagined how amazing it would feel when I crossed the line at a year.

Whenever I thought about my progress, I always imagined the tortured version of myself that I could be sitting on the side of the road, only visible through my rearview mirror. I was never going back to that life. Ever.

Around the time I hit eight months, I started to wonder if I might be able to sit down and have a glass of wine or a beer one day. Just one, just to see. I thought things like: ""Maybe I'm cured."" ""Maybe all the things I've learned about the psychology of addiction have gotten me to a place where I can see what's happening in real time and abstain."" These should have been warning signs to me, but I either didn't see them as such, or simply didn't want to.

I was getting ready for a family camping trip, and I started thinking about how cool it would be to only have one or two on vacation. Just to enjoy the experience, I wrote about it a few times feeling conflicted, and ultimately convinced myself that if I wanted to, it was no big deal. The first few days of camp were great, and I was totally sober and having a wonderful time with my family after not having seen them since before COVID.

Around the halfway point, I started thinking about how much the pandemic had taken from us over the last 18 months, and how it would be so cool to just feel normal again, that this was normal. I had somehow switched the track. I gave myself so much by getting sober and quitting drinking, and here I was telling myself that COVID was the culprit. ""COVID had made it impossible for me to have a drink."" ""It was the one that made me watch Tiger King in my pajamas at 11 am."" ""I didn't have a problem anymore.""

I decided to go and pick up some of my favorite drinks before the campfire got started. People who knew I was on my journey, expressed their doubts, but I was quick to calm their fears by saying it was only on vacation. Which is what I believed. I went to the liquor store with no real qualms about what I was doing and picked up a bottle of pre-mixed margarita and a couple of bottles of peanut butter milk stout just in case I didn't like it.

I got back to camp and poured a margarita. I tasted it expecting a rapturous sensation on my palate, but it tasted nothing like what I remembered. It was a sour; vile concoction and I was quick to complain about it and hand it off. I thought maybe the stout would be better, so I popped the top but was again confronted with the reality of a foul-tasting poison being in my mouth. Instead of stopping right there and being done, I continued playing a demented game of Goldilocks and the three drinks until I settled on a light beer that I never would have considered when I was a heavy drinker...

The beer tasted not as bad as everything else, so I decided to force myself to drink it...

Once it was done, I decided to try a margarita again. It tasted better. I spent the evening laughing and enjoying myself, I didn't get wasted and fall asleep in my chair, and I didn't do anything embarrassing - The highest of bars... I even woke up the next morning smiling because I thought I had beaten addiction and could put the alcohol down whenever I wanted. The rest of the time at camp was filled with reasonable drinking. I didn't get super wasted, I mostly only drank at night around the campfire, and I kept my attitude in check.

I started to suspect that things were not as I had supposed when I had to tell myself to be kind to a family member one morning after a long night of drinking. This was not something I usually needed to tell myself. I could sense that I was on edge and irritable but convinced myself it wasn't a problem because I had noticed it and corrected my attitude. The rest of camp was great, and we had a great time with the family.

I drove back home with my mom, a long road trip. I talked all about how I felt like this could be how I do things: Just on special occasions, thinking of future trips to Greece and Russia, to the beach and maybe at weddings. Sifting through my imagination for times when it would be acceptable to have a drink.

Of course, I would stop again when we got back for some fitness challenges that I needed to do, and I’d be keeping it out at least three months at a time. I just wanted to grab a couple of beers the evening after getting home because it had been such a long trip, and I wanted to chill out and enjoy myself. I drove to the liquor store knowing in my heart that this was something different. I hadn’t felt any real shame on the trip but driving out being back home set off some alarms in my heart. I picked up two six packs of beer just in case I wanted more than six beers, which again set of some alarms, and I debated with myself for about five minutes on whether or not to just buy one. I bought two, never can be too careful, and I didn’t want to have to go out again later.

I messaged my best friend who is sober and who has been my support and biggest inspiration (I conveniently didn’t message him before I decided to drink, because “I didn’t feel like I needed to”) and told him that I’d drank. He asked me how I felt about it, and I gave him some song and dance about rewiring my brain and being able to control it in a text. He called me and we talked a lot about it, and he ultimately convinced me to take a closer look at my behaviors leading up to this relapse. He also told me that he knows he can never drink again, because he knows where he would end up. Going on to say that there isn’t a drinker alive who drinks less now than when they started. Of course, he was right, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me, I’d already bought the beer.

I stayed up until 3 am drinking and looking for something good to watch on television, and ultimately finding nothing of substance to enjoy, and ultimately went to sleep thinking I’d be fine in the morning. I woke up instantly feeling like had felt on any particular night nine to ten months ago and knew that I had crossed the line. Not just that I had crossed the line, but that I had completely wrecked my progress, and was not, in fact, cured.

A big part of me wanted to berate myself or focus on how much I’d fucked up and how much I’d lost.

That isn’t productive though, and it’s not the way forward for my recovery. Honesty and compassion are cleansing water and healing salve that help you on your way to tomorrow.

So, for now I must be honest and say the thing that I’ve never been able to admit openly: I am an alcoholic.

And after that, I have to forgive myself for it, and for letting it control my life with the knowledge that I’m going to have to fight for what’s important to me, and stay vigilant no matter what time in my life I’m in. There will never be a time when it’s alright for me to drink.

For me drinking, is courting oblivion in small increments, and I love being alive too much to ever want to be here writing this again.

Today is day zero.

864,My confession,"What you are about to read may disgust you. I was strongly hesitating if I should post it as the level of my embarrassment for my drunk actions is sky up high. I am doing it because I believe the confession is a part of healing and acceptance - both so essential to work on yourself to become a decent human being again. 

- I was abusive verbally towards my partner
- I was abusive verbally towards my parents plus I pushed my father once 
- I stole alcohol from the shop when my partner hid my money and bank cards
- I was drunk in a hospital when my partner gave a born to our second child
- I spent new years eve in arrest
- I was sending disgustingly offensive messages to my dearest friends
- I was cheating on my partner
- lost a dream job
- I used to take kids out for a pizza so I could do quick shot as I could not drink at home
- I spent a real fortune on booze. I could save it for my kids. 

Surely I could find more of it. 

All this done when drunk. I had so many examples. Yet I was still going back to drinking. 

It is hard to type it. 

You are decent man. You love people. You have a moral code. Helping others on every occasion. Both strangers and the close ones. And then alcohol brings out the worse of the worse. You wake up in the morning, recall what you did and start drinking again as you do not believe you could behave this way and want to forget about it. I noticed that people were forgiving but I do not know If I can forgive it to myself.",t3_nyb732

866,I'm staring at 5 empty vodka bottles wondering where the last week went.,"Today is Day 1 for me.

I've always known that I've had a problem with drinking. My student days were one long blur and my results showed for it. When I graduated, I thought I would mature and things would get better. But they rarely did.

I moved in with my family who objected to my drinking, but I would always find a way around it. I would sneak bottles into my room. I would go for a night out and not come back until the next morning. And when my family had had enough of me, they gave me an ultimatum: stop drinking or move out.

I chose the latter. I wanted to move closer to my partner anyway, and I was sick of being so imprisoned. But I didn't realise that my family were thinking of my wellbeing.

I moved away for a year, and I was experiencing the same problems. I used to drink heavily at the weekend and arrive at work on Monday with a stinking hangover. This was virtually every weekend. My partner was concerned but I always brushed it off. He was teetotal and I couldn't understand why he was so annoyed at my drinking. Eventually, we had to break up as I couldn't reconcile my feelings for the drink with my feelings for him. 

Then the pandemic hit. I didn't want to stay alone in my bedroom with a bottle. So, I moved back in with my sister on a condition: no more drinking. It worked for about 9 months. Everytime I wanted a drink, I would think about everything I had gone through the last time and all the advantages of having my family around me. I was working from home while doing a graduate course and everything was going well.

Around this January, when I had done my first exam, I asked my sister if I could have a celebratory drink. It would be capped, and she could take the bottle off me at any point. She reluctantly agreed but said that if things go badly, I should let her know.

It started slowly, three drinks of one evening. Then the next weekend, I had another three drinks. Then the next weekend I polished off the bottle. I bought another bottle and kept it in my desk drawer. Every weekend, without fail, I would open that drawer and take a few swigs. I convinced myself that it was to destress after a long week of work and class.

Six months have now passed and I'm really going off the rails. Last month, I thought I had hit rock bottom. I woke up to find three empty vodka bottles next to my bed after a weekend. I was scared I had actually poisoned myself and was going to seek medical advice, but I couldn't get an appointment. That's when I found this reddit, but I did nothing. I occasionally checked to read a testimony but I was convinced this didn't apply to me.

Then this week happened. On Sunday, I picked up a bottle. Somehow I signed in to work but I can barely remember a thing. I've spent an entire week drunk and that thought makes me sick to my stomach. And that brings me to where I am now: staring at 5 bottles of vodka, wondering how I got here. I feel so disgusted with myself and I'm committed to stop now. 

I think my family are at their last straw again, and with the pandemic reaching the end, I'm scared of what they'll tell me to do. I've made so many false promises, I don't think they can trust me not to do something stupid ever again. I will be seeking medical advice this time. But above all, I need to make a commitment to myself that I will never do this again.

So, today, I say is Day 1 and may there be many more to come. IWNDWYT!",t3_ny1q49

Every time I tried quitting alcohol before I eventually failed because I found myself too bored and lonely. I was never a marijuana user in my teens and early 20s because alcohol was something I liked over weed from an early age. 

I can honestly say if I had not switched to pot I would be drinking again. I honestly wish there was not such a phobia associated with switching from alcohol to pot for individuals who can’t completely abstain from BOTH substances.

It’s upsetting, and difficult in my new sobriety. After getting the news, I did give myself permission today to go drink a ton of kombucha, like I used to drink alcohol. Had enough to feel the tiniest weird buzz, but it kept me from getting hammered like I was tempted to. I just knew that if I went to booze, it would be the start of a multiple day relapse. So, as strange as it seems, my booch strategy worked. Some hard-core folks might call me out on it, but I know where my head is at, I’m lying in bed at 9pm, not drunk, and looking forward to a nice long run in the morning.

Despite not get the job offer, in a way I’m relieved to be able to move to plan B after waiting so long. My industry is on fire right now, and I very well may end up in an even better position in the very near future.

I will not drink with you today, my friends.

*Update 6/12/21*
I did indeed get my long run in this morning.
I do not recommend the “chug kombucha” method of overcoming drinking urges. It worked yesterday, but kombucha is tea based, for one, so  the caffeine really interfered with my sleep quality. Also, drinking anything compulsively to overcome an urge is probably not a good long term strategy, as it could be a slippery slope. So I’ll continue to enjoy the booch in moderation, but will look to other methods to ride out any urges that come.

Thank you for all the kind words on the job. The future looks bright; I already have a couple really good options in front of me.",t3_nxyjh1
883,I let my husband support me,"Today is day 3 of actively choosing not to drink. 

Day 1 was easy; I was hungover! 

Day 2, I commented on someone's post ""IWNDWYT"". Then I proceeded to have a stressful day full of lots of triggers for drinking. I had to drive off the island, which has been difficult since a terrible car accident. (I was sober during it. Promise!) I kept anxiety attacks at bay. I had to be around my ex husband, who had been abusive, while our daughter had to go under general anesthesia for some dental work. 

I pulled out a lot of coping skills to get through, but by evening I was still wanting to drink. It felt like an urgent, ""I hate being in my skin"" compulsion to drink. So I did something I hadn't done before. I told my husband, who is amazing, that for the first time ever, I commented on here vowing not to drink. I also told him about my stressful day, and feeling like a bad mother, and my shame and bad feelings. 

I talk to my husband about nearly everything, but I've never told him about my intentions to not drink for the day. I was too afraid of failing, and also too afraid the accountability would hold me to it if I felt weak later on. 

He was wonderful and there for me, and he helped me have the strength not to crawl inside a bottle last night. We did some laundry and then went to a local place we love for some non-alcoholic beverages, and I spent time with my friends. A couple of them asked why I wasn't getting a beer or wine, and I told them I had decided to not drink when having a bad day. They thought that was a great idea, and they told me about some of our other friends who do the same. 

After that, conversation just went on as normal, and I enjoyed not getting intoxicated, and knowing I wouldn't get a hangover. I felt proud of myself. 

I still feel proud of myself, so I want to do it again. This is my very first post here in this subreddit after much lurking, and y'all, IWNDWYT.",t3_nyad2b
884,Day 15: The Final Frontier?,"So, this is officially the longest I've gone 100% sober this year. I made it to day 14 a few times, but havent made it past today. 

Now I remember why. Oh boy, the justifications are strong today. ""It's Saturday."" ""I had a productive morning."" ""I've done all my chores."" ""It'll help me relax and write."" (SPOILER ALERT: NO IT WONT! IT NEVER DOES!)

But, as cliche as it sounds, theres something different this time, something deeper that's fully resolved not to give in. It's like, I've removed that course of action as a possibility even if I'm not happy about it. If I have to I'll just hang on through the rest of the day, distract myself and watch tv until I can go to bed.

But a fear is rising that my life will just become a series of trying to hang on through the day. That this difficult sobriety will become the norm. On my latest relapse post, someone commented that I could try just hanging on and seeing if it gets better on day 16, 17, etc. I guess I'm afraid that it wont. 

I know this is a mental block. I know this is the fading of post-relapse motivation and when the real work is starting. The long work. The work I'm least experienced with. I know this is me getting bored with sobriety, that it's losing its shiny new feel. I know that's normal, and should happen. I guess I just dont know how to feel about it.

Sorry this is a bit all over the place, but it helps to just write it out.

I think what I should focus on is my deep resolve. In my core, I feel that I'm done being intoxicated. This discomfort is a surface feeling. I should trust that it will pass. I cant hope to get anywhere on a path if I'm constantly changing directions. I'm done with that. It's time to stay the course, and trust it will open up.

But, you know what? I'm gonna have a diet cheat day. Maybe I've got a case of the fuck its, maybe so. But I can spend that on chocolate and binging Smallville (SOMEBODY SAAAVEEE MEEEE!) and not on poisoning my brain and body. Tomorrow I can start a shiny new exercise and diet regime and wait for that to lose its shine. And I'll be able to start tomorrow because im not hanging out my arse.

890,The compulsion is madness...,"Hey all,

Not sure where to start but you all seem like a kind bunch. :)

I've struggled with my drinking for a number of years now and the temptation to head to the shop to buy a bottle of wine is great especially as I'm home alone. I hate how I have this compulsion. Only the other day I went and drank a bottle and a half of wine, dont remember going to bed, woke up at 3am with the light and the tv on and had to ask to work from home the next day as I kept wanting to throw up. 

The compulsion is complete madness. If it was a type of food that caused that you would probably not eat it again. So why do I keep going back to drink with my rose tinted goggles? As my tolerance goes up the more I drink and the worse the hangovers. My hangovers are terrible and it's very usual that I just puke up bile for most of the day. It's also been normal for me to check my texts or my history in the morning. I've properly embarrassed myself in the past with messages that probably make me sound like a mad woman. I can never bear to read them back.

I'm not going to drink tonight, I'm going to try to keep myself occupied tonight and I might have a coffee or two. It's not ideal but it's the lesser of the evils.

Anyway thanks for reading my rant, it's just I needed to get it out there to save myself making yet another mistake. I could easily write an essay about the problems drink has caused over the years but I would be here a very long time.

892,Where is joy?,"My day 1 was 28 days ago. The last two weeks were pretty easy to maintain, I think having a brand new job helped, a startup too so I’m busy all the time. 



On Wednesday we had a get together in a bar with colleagues, I reluctantly agreed to come, had two non alcoholic beers and left pretty early. I could not feel even a tiny bit proud about myself and could not appreciate the fact that I’m going to bed knowing I’ll wake up tomorrow feeling decent. 



I struggled with anxiety my whole life and last year I overcame it through therapy and with the help of Effexor. And sometimes I hate being healthy. After becoming a confident person I realized that I’m an extrovert and just love being the center of attention which was easy to achieve while drinking. Now I don’t go out at all because all my “friends” actually were nothing but my drinking buddies. I miss feeling good about myself and all this stuff like yoga, meditation, walks or what have you does shit for me. I want to socialize. 



I thought after ditching alcohol I would crave it but I only crave social interactions and that feeling when a bunch of people laugh at my jokes. I have no idea how to seek companions without actually going anywhere.

893,Starting over after a 4 month relapse,"I am both hopeful and also a bit terrified. I had 8 months of what felt like really positive sobriety and active recovery. I was pushing myself in therapy, really focusing on self-care, and feeling generally good.

And then the wheels sort of fell off. Looking back, I didn't realize how anxious a work situation had made me (very anxious) and how draining and re-traumatizing some of the trauma work I was doing was. In my desire to push--I really was just not focusing on my mental health and actual needs.

Working from home--I started solo drinking again. Really heavy binges where days would blur into each other while doing the sort of bare minimum at work. I told people close to me that I had relapsed as though admitting it would magically put me on track again, but of course just pretended that I was sober again. I felt so haphazard. I blew insane amounts of money on booze delivery. I stopped caring (which, in retrospect, was the relief I was looking for, but of course, alcohol doesn't work because, for me at least, it only feeds my anxiety monster). It feels like I was in a four-month nightmare filled with deception and not caring for myself or anything else. I feel like I torpedoed my life. But I also know drinking won't help me repair anything.

Today is day one and I feel back to bare bones and starting on day 1. As in, just make sure you shower, go outside, and don't drink bare bones. I really don't feel like I have another place to just say it. I'm so grateful this community exists. IWNDWYT. ",t3_ny6w3r

Whether it’s a door banging, a car horn honking, or glass smashing. A wave of fear and anguish overpowers me. I also feel gross tremor all over my body and back, like something is crawling on it, along with some teeth chattering. Most medical studies show the effects from PAWS lighten up after two weeks. It is almost Monday again which will be two weeks and I still feel like an anxious piece of shit. When will these nasty physiological side effects subside? Thank you and god bless.

896,I had a HUGE wake up call and I’m DONE.,"I’ve posted here a few times before, but I never took quitting drinking until two days ago. My boyfriend and I are severe alcoholics, even more so during the month of May and this month because both of us have been dealing with extreme stress. I believe these two days are the first two that either of us have legitimately been sober in a long time. 

Two days ago started off as usual. We met up, had breakfast and were generally all right. We started drinking early in the day like we usually do. The whole day was fine until we started throwing back whiskey. He had 3 pints and I had 3 40’s, a natty daddy, and was taking shots of the whiskey. 

Once it hit about 10pm, things took a huge turn for the worst and we started arguing, I don’t even remember why. But he physically tried to remove me from his place, which in turn made me want to fight. I scratched his face up and bit him hard enough to break skin. He choked me out and then the next thing I remember was these men pounding on the door with the cops. I had to leave and thought for sure I was going to jail. But the cops ended up taking me home. 

My boyfriend is now in rehab, and I’m home detoxing which has been absolutely awful. While sober, NEVER in our right minds would this have ever fucking happened and I’m extremely ashamed. Our relationship is great while we’re sober. Never in my dreams would I have ever imagined this happened.

So, I’m done. I’m done for good for my sake. I’m tired of always feeling sick when I don’t have at least a beer in me, tired of constantly having to do damage control because of stupid shit I said while drunk. I’m taking accountability for my actions and am starting a new chapter in my life. 

Both of us feel extremely bad about the situation. Which is why he went off to rehab and I’m trying to fight these withdrawals now. 

I just want things to be better.",t3_ny7e9t
897,Saturday share for 12 june 2021,"I just found this after feeling like crap all day. And it made my day feel allot better. And just wanted to share my storie.

I am 20 days sober this day. For 57 days ago my gf said that if I dont stop drinking I she is going to leave me.  We an child that is 1 year and 7 months old. 
Then i went into an pre drugrehab treatment I said I wanted to into an rehab but since I had an job and everything they wanted to try daytreatment once an week befor rehab. And set me on Antabus

I were 35 days without drinking then I drank for 2 days befor stopping now I am 20 days sober again and its not easy.

Going to AA is the only thing that helps I got and sponsor and everything. Going to rehab in 5 weeks. 

Befor I ignored my child cause of my drinking and wanted him gone. Befor he was borne I was  drinking nonstop and didnt survie without some alchol.

At the clinic they took my drivng license and contacted childservies. 
My girlfriend dosent drink and is my everything she has been so good. She and my soon is all I really carw about.

Sorry for bad english.

898,Slightly off-topic: going to the dentist,"Wondering whether anyone else on this board has experiences with dental phobia and/or self-neglect that manifested as not maintaining great oral hygiene or going to the dentist for years. I feel like among heavy drinkers and people with alcohol use disorder, I might find a few people who have struggled with this. I personally have a very intense and irrational fear of the dentist---that, along with not having dental insurance, has kept me from going for years, but this past weekend I noticed what I (and my dental student friend) believe is probably an abscess. Not in any pain, but I really can't put off going to the dentist anymore. So I have an appointment with a private dentist on Monday and one at the University dental clinic in about two weeks---my friend informs me that depending on what I need done, the costs may be comparable, but for some procedures the dental school will be cheaper.

I'm terrified (but the nice dentist knows this, I told the office!) and I feel like this is another important step in taking control of my health and doing my best to make sure that I'm in the best condition I can be to live the rest of my life. I'm gaining such clarity now and my anxiety is reduced so profoundly---I wonder how long it would have taken me to notice this weird thing on my gums if I were still drinking---and how much longer it would have taken me to make an appointment and start seriously addressing my oral health. (I have been brushing regularly and flossing sporadically throughout my life, but I haven't been to the dentist in about 15 years, I reckon. And I'm 36. My mouth is a bit of a mess.)

Well, thanks for listening. I'll be brave and try not to faint on Monday and IWNDWYT.",t3_nycemd

902,One day under my belt,"Today is day two. I've been a long time lurker trying to figure out just how to be open and admit I have a problem rather than continue to drown it in self-deprecation and clever focus-shifting bits when those closest try bringing it to my attention. At least I thought they were clever. My loved ones more than likely found them insufferable. 

It has been at least 5 years since I went more than a day without drinking. That's excluding the few times that a hangover was so bad I couldn't fathom the thought of a drink on day two. I've always been more of a consistent drinker vs. quantity drinker. The interesting thing I didn't realize is that those roads lead to the same place. Sure, I was consistent and didn't get wasted often. But the quantity grew and grew before I could even think about stopping it. Turned into 12+ a day over the course of 8-10 hours. It became everything I do. 

I often joked about never having any new developments in my life. I started resenting the questions ""what's new with you?"" or ""what've you been up to?"" only because I did not have an answer. Nothing was new. I work, I come home, I drink. It quickly became ""I don't have time to do anything because work is so exhausting. I need to relax."" long before I realized that the drink was actually taking the time away from me. I don't want to read when I drink. I don't want to learn when I drink. I don't want to create music when I drink. 

It's gotten to the point where I am keenly aware of the many ways that the decision to drink and ""take a load off"" is distracting me from goals, straining relationships, increasing my anxiety, and making me unsure of what the future could hold. I need to take care of me. I've never particularly cared for me, but the people I care about do. I need to hear them. Actually hear them.

It is because of them that I have the courage to post here and to share my story. They've helped me understand, not only that I don't have to do this alone, but that there are so many in similar boats. I need the support. I need the community. I need to stop drinking. 

Thank you for reading this. I've been incredibly inspired by many of your stories throughout the years. I'm happy to be here and to actually join this community.

903,Is this Jaundice?,"Hi, I posted a few weeks ago. I drank pretty hard for the last 9 years. First two years not that bad. Then I drank for 10 beers plus or minus a few for 3 years. Then I cut back a lot and drank only once a week for a year or two. But when Covid happened I ramped it up quite a bit a few times a week maybe 10-12 drinks a night. Anyway, I've only drank twice in the last 8 or 9 weeks. I decided to cut back from abdominal pain center and right. I noticed that my hands, feet, and nose when pressed or scrunched look a little yellow. My eyes appear to be fine as well as my mouth.

913,I hate doing drinking-related stuff sober. Partner is having a hard time to understand.,"So we went to this beer garden outdoor thing the other night because it was a nice summer night and world is starting to open up here also so what the hell. There were four of us and none of us had an alcoholic drink, eventhough my partner and her friend drink occasionally. We didn't stay for long and afterwards I was really bummed out because let's face it: it was miserable as hell. I didn't feel sorry for the other people getting drunk, I felt sorry for ME for not being able to enjoy alcohol in a warm sunny night. I envied them and hated my sober life at that point so it totally sucked.


We had a talk afterwards with my GF and I told her that maybe I shouldn't even bother to come along next time to any occasion which is centered around drinking. I mean I can totally live with myself hanging around the house or do outdoors or anything that doesn't relate to alcohol. So if there's a get-together with friends and it's going to include drinking or be in a location where ppl drink I prefer to opt-out so I don't feel miserable.


My GF thinks that I should try and learn to enjoy those occasions and keeps saying no one will think odd of me not drinking. I know that and I really don't care what other people think. But here's the thing. I don't know why I would even need to learn to enjoy those things? Why would I have to force myself to situations where I know I'll feel like shit while I already know tons of other things that don't cause that? I don't know if she thought that I just stop drinking and still keep going to bars and parties like nothing happened. I feel like I don't want any of that stuff in my life anymore. But also I don't want to constantly hurt her feelings by saying no to every occasion. She barely drinks herself and I know she just wants us to hang around with friends but to me it's torture every time and I feel I have the right to say no. She also understands my reasons to choose sobriety and totally supports that but sometimes I feel she just doesn't fully ""get it"".

914,"The Daily Check-In for Saturday, June 12th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

  

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

If you’d like to give back to the /r/stopdrinking community and have 30 days or more sober, why not consider hosting the DCI for a week? Let /u/sainthomer know and we’ll get you all signed up!

Happy day, friends! It has been quite a fascinating week. I have been so overwhelmed with gratitude for having the opportunity to host the DCI. Anytime that I could steal away a couple of minutes, I would read as many of your check-ins as possible, and they filled me with love. As many of you know, I also started a new job this week, and it has been absolutely wonderful. I now understand the sentiment, “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” I’ve found it, friends. What a blessing.

This past week we've talked about accountability and motivation, dreams and hopes, gratitude, Doing Nothing, time, and community. The most beautiful thing about making a decision to take my life back from the grips of alcohol (and other drugs) is that I have now facilitated the opportunity to not only achieve, but thrive in all of the above. That’s freaking incredible, and overwhelming at the same time. But the overwhelm is not centered in fear; it is centered in oodles of love and gratitude. 

I’m going to keep doing whatever it takes to maintain my personal responsibility to take care of myself, my family – my life, in general. When I am not drinking, I am 110% in – living, appreciating, breathing, and kicking ass in every area. If this is your first check-in, you’re lurking, early on the path, or wherever your journey stands in this moment, please know that this is available to us all, so long as we make the daily decision not to drink alcohol and simply show up in our lives.

It is now time for me to hand the torch over to the next amazing host. It has been a pleasure serving the community this week – thank you for having me!

Enjoy your super Saturday. I will not drink with you today!",t3_nxwhm2
915,I have to go to the liquor store today...,"I am partway through This Naked Mind (excellent book so far) and the bits about how ingrained alcohol is in our culture is hitting home today.

I 'must' bring a bottle of wine to the neighbors BBQ tonight, apparently nothing else is really acceptable (??). Spouse expects it and the neighbors do (or so it seems - this is all unsaid right?)

I feel OK, I know I can just buy the one bottle and not slip in a few extra for myself. But I am planning on taking the wife instead of going alone, that will help.

For tonight I already have non-alcoholic beer to take with me.

I am already resenting how I 'must' do this. In the past when I was drinking, sure, take something, I will drink while there. But if I am not drinking why do I still have to take something? We need to change this societal expectation.

What do you all take as a gift if not alcohol? Normally I do take food but these neighbors in particular never seem to really appreciate it. Nothing is said but you get that feeling..

People almost didn't believe me but I didn't care, the most important thing was that I proved to myself I could do it. Then I started doing it again but very little. Actually, my goal was just to have A NORMAL DRINKING BEHAVIOR LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I didn't want to stand there at parties or my sisters graduation and be the only weirdo not drinking because I'm a fuckin alcoholic. I just want to be normal, like everyone else. But then I slowly got those fuckin hangovers where I always had to drink the day after. And the day after that. And the day after that. And so on and so on. So I would go into these weekly periods where I would drink 24/7. Not answering my phone, calling in sick from work with extremely good excuses (trust me, I'm the master, and that's not a good thing), stop cleaning my apartment, stop taking showers, financially ruin myself and so on.

That's your concious torturing yourself after doing stuff that is not good for you. But that is also a self-destructive behavior.  So what do I do in this conflict within me? I dunno. I would like to end this with a warm hug and a goodbye to all you guys and send some love and so on and so on.... But also, try specifically to make your life better in anyways you can.

926,"Saturday Share For June 12, 2021","Well here we go, it is my turn to share. I have told this story in bits and pieces many times over the years, but never really in succession. I’ll start by I am a 36-year-old from a small town in Nova Scotia, Canada, and I am an alcoholic. I have no idea how long this is going to be, and be warned in advance that I write for a living, so it may end up a bit lengthy. Try to prepare for 10 to 15 minutes of reading. For anyone interested, I had written a novel based on some of my time inside, with some fiction added in. I have the rough first ten chapters still somewhere on an old blog I could link to.

I am leaving out a lot of specific incidents, partly due to poor memory, and partly due to there being just oo much to choose from.

I was born a fighter. 16 weeks premature, less than two pounds, and the smaller of two twin boys delivered by emergency c-section. For most of my young life, I was under-sized and constantly sick with something. I thankfully had an amazing family who gave me everything a child could have asked for to succeed, but nothing would have prepared me for addiction. 

Up until around the age of 12 I was on the same path as my older brother, the golden child. I was top in my class for everything and could do no wrong. One thing I remember from that time period is a lot of drinking at family functions, and my mother always harping on me that I have a big risk of becoming an alcoholic due to it running on both sides. (That may have been the wrong way to go about it mum).

That summer going from elementary school to junior high, everything changed. My twin brother and I always hung out together, we were best friends, inseparable, and I really looked up to him as the smaller twin. We had a few older friends that we hung out with that summer, and one of those nights they wanted us to chip in on liquor to be purchased by one of their older brothers. Of course, my brother and I had money, we were from a well off family and also worked, so we jumped on the chance to look cool.

Nothing crazy happened during that summer, or the following years of junior high and high school. Sure there are lots of hilarious/scary memories, and it certainly guided my life in a different direction, but I didn’t see any negatives about drinking. In high school, I worked, got high, skipped half my classes, and still made the honour roll. I honestly don’t remember enough from these years to have any impactful memories. 

The one thing that sticks out is being hammered at my graduation/prom, dumping rum all over the front of my tux before doing the grand march, and ignoring every person looking to shake my hand. That was normal for me. I don’t talk about friends from this era, as I honestly always felt like my brother was friends with everyone and I just tagged along. This opened up a can of worms later in life in therapy hahaha.

I had no sweet clue what I wanted to do after high school, I just planned to go to university like I was expected to. So I enrolled in a top Public Relations program at a Nova Scotia university without so much as researching the school or program first. My mother had gone to that school, and I just blindly followed along.

Well, freedom is not really a great thing for a budding chronic alcoholic. My first two years at school were spent in residence, and I actually did well for the first term or two, even being on the Dean’s list. Yet alcohol became a daily thing, along with smoking weed, and eventually dabbling in hard drugs. One of many injuries incurred over my life was in my freshman year. I jumped up on the railing of a balcony to hit on a cute girl, and off I went. 15 feet down, right arm caught in the bars, and face plant on the pavement. My shoulder still sits about three inches lower these days. For my third year of school, my twin brother and I decided to get an apartment together in the city, as he had dropped out of school but planned on working.

As I was in school and all my brother could find was minimum wage work, my parents offered to pay for our apartment and utilities. That third year I don’t think I attended more than a quarter of my classes, and I barely scraped by. This was also the year I changed degrees because I hated the thought of being a PR snake. You could chart my university grades on a sliding scale very nicely.

So by this time Matt and I were drinking every day together and we had both gotten a job at a local Wendys; one of those old fashioned ones. We also started getting into coke pretty heavily with a buddy of ours, eventually getting into transporting it and almost getting fucked over bad. There were lots of lines, various pills, and always booze on the go, even at closing shifts at work. My brother and I found a great group that we worked with, partied with, and really just became like family, but it didn’t last.

Sometime a little later my brother got a call that one of the family dealerships needed him, and he promptly packed up and moved back home, leaving me alone for the first time without my brother. This just resulted in me shutting down and drinking everything in sight until my aunt and uncle offered for me to move in with them.

I moved in with them and was still working my job at Wendy’s for a little while. I’d sneak bottles in late at night and drink in their basement until all hours of the morning. Then they decided to go to France, and I got their house for two months. I do not remember those two months, just that it ended in my first trip to rehab.

The rehab facility I was sent to was a private one that my one uncle referred me to, as he was a recovering alcoholic of 40 some odd years. Turns out this was not what I wanted, and I just went because I thought it would get people off my back. This facility lets clients go home on the weekends with the promise of testing when they returned to keep them accountable. I drank every weekend I went home, and they tested every single person except me… I’ll never understand it.

I got home and lived with my parents for a while. My mother had recently purchased a condo for my twin to live in, and I quickly moved in with him to get some space. This, again, was not a good idea. My brother had left our family business due to stress and picked up a job working shift at a tire factory, I worked at Blockbuster for a while and then started in service at the family dealership. Blockbuster is still my favourite job ever, and I’d do that shit for free these days. During this time the drinking never stopped, and drugs like cocaine, ecstasy, and even heroin were regular things. 

After about two years in service I was promoted to the sales department, but not before getting attacked outside a local bar and receiving a skull fracture and concussion while being nine times the legal limit. I was, and still assume I am, an amazing salesman. To me, the job was so simple, if not filled with disappointments, frustrations, and soooooo many quiet hours. I did well selling cars but the head injury and alcohol were in control.

After missing too much time due to hangovers and migraines, I just walked in one day and quit. I had it in my head that I couldn’t do it anymore and just quit. I used what little money I had leftover to drink myself into oblivion. All those years at the condo and in the city consisted of me sitting in my tiny bedroom, mattress on the floor, drinking and smoking. I had no social life, no friends, no girlfriend for about a decade.

Feel free to take a break if you need to at this point, because things really haven’t even started getting interesting yet. We still have from 2013 until now to unravel, and those were increasingly erratic and idiotic years.

At this point my parents asked me to move back with them to sober up. I got sober for a couple of weeks, I think, but then just started sneaking my drinking in the basement. I had to get out of there so I applied for an IT program at a technical school in the city. I found an apartment and my family helped me move back to the city again. 

\- Somewhere in this period of time I also lost 140 pounds, but for the life of me I can’t remember when it was, and I still maintain the weight.- 

The minute they left I walked to the liquor store and an epic binge was starting. 

For roughly three weeks I took my student loan money and drank 24/7. I mean it was every waking hour with beer and liquor, along with an assortment of other things. I had gone online and met a local girl who dabbled in some illegal services. As a drunk lonely guy, I wanted some company, so I paid this girl for a bit of her time and we ended up becoming buddies I suppose. She would come over with alcohol, cocaine, molly, heroin, and anything else she could get her hands on. 

One morning I drunkenly woke up, snorted a mixture of mystery powder, and realized I had no smokes, and that wouldn’t do. My brain immediately told me to just go take some from the store next door. I don’t know why my brain did this, as I had never committed theft or robbery in my life. In my head, it wasn’t really a theft as I was going to pay them back later.

From the reports, I entered the store with tube socks on my hands and told someone to leave. Of course that someone called the police. My alcohol and drug-fueled genius landed me in lockup with charges of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. May I remind everyone that this was for one pack of cigarettes….

So I end up being transferred to the local provincial jail, affectionately known as Burnside here. This is where I got to enjoy my first major detox, in a jail cell with some gang member I did not know or trust. My lovely cellmate also forced me to cheek my valium and give it to him, so I suffered a seizure. I did this because my first introduction to him and his friends consisted of me getting my ass kicked for my dinner.

Thankfully my amazing parents bailed me out with the conditions that I was on house arrest and had to go immediately from jail to the rehab centre. I’ll never forget the sense of relief when I got into the van, looking like Osama bin Laden, and just crying my damn eyes out.

I spent the next three months at Searidge. This facility was built in an old motel and was my introduction to many things, including cognitive behavioural therapy and indigenous culture. This place changed me as a person, and it is where I started to figure out who I really was. My first time here I excelled at everything, learned I could write, and I left with so much hope and promise.

While at my parents on house arrest I met my first serious girlfriend online, R. She was a very different person than men, but I was desperate for companionship and we formed a relationship. Roughly 7 months into my sobriety I had a slip, and my mother called the police and I was arrested again.

This time I spent two weeks in Burnside with a new cellmate with who I was very naive. Suffice to say you don’t trust people you meet in jail; they end up robbing you at gunpoint. I have always been a bit naive and tried to see the good in people, which has burned me countless times.

I get released again on bail, and back to Searidge I go for a refresher course. I have to stress again, the people who worked here were amazing, well most of them. During my stay my gf came for a visit and had some news. We slept together, and then she decided it was a great time to tell me she got my brother drunk and fucked him too. She was mad at me for getting arrested.

Well that relationship should have ended there, but it didn’t. I got out and really didn’t plan on stopping my drinking. I learned about a lovely little drug called Welbutrin while inside, as it acted as a poor man’s coke. Just my luck that I had been prescribed this medication already in copious amounts. 

During this time I had pled guilty to lesser charges, after one more arrest that ended up with me having six staples in my head. I also started mixing my lovely Welbutrin with real coke, and it ended up driving me to call Searidge again. My sinuses are still a mess to this day. This had me stay there for another three months, and I think we are in 2016 at this point. 

My memories aren’t 100 per cent on timelines and such, but now I was in my shitty one-bedroom apartment, R and I were officially done, and I had signed up to do culinary school. Unfortunately, three months in my back finally gave out, and subsequent surgery has left me unable to do regular work. 

Okay, so school wasn’t an option, work wasn’t an option, so I suppose I figured misery was my best bet. I was broke and heard from some alcoholic friends that mouthwash was a really good drunk. I’ll never forget the first time buying a bottle and trying it. Mouthwash does not taste good, regardless of how cold you try to make it. It also is not the same type of drunk as regular alcohol, and it is extremely easy to blackout and have mood swings.

I’m going to guess it is 2017 at this point, and the next two years consist of nothing but mouthwash, pawning stuff, doing horrible things for cash, and more mouthwash. My twin also got into injecting IV drugs at this point, and I hate to say I had many days where I did the same.

In December of 2018, I was on plenty of fish just trolling around like my usual drunk self. I messaged a local girl, S, and we started talking. I didn’t see any of the red flags, may have been too drunk, desperate, lonely, or a combination of them. She was currently pregnant, living at a shelter for abused women, and had children from two other men. I didn’t care.

S and I started getting very close. She was an aspiring tattoo artist, sex addict, and had been dealt an unfair hand in life. I quickly let her move in with me, as she was homeless, and I was not drinking at all. Then we found out that she was getting her kids back as we had proven stability. In 24 hours I was going to become a dad….

Becoming a stepdad changed me. Until the fateful day in October of 2020 I did not drink, I took care of two very difficult children, and I worked my ass off for chicken scratch doing freelance writing projects. S did what she could, but she suffered from mental health issues and our relationship started deteriorating.

After 9 months of sobriety I lost it over a very small thing. I was woken up around 3am to lil baby G crying, like usual. This baby just did not sleep well, and it was normally on me to get up and take care of it. I was on edge that day and lost my cool, screaming at the baby to shut up.

His mother stormed out screaming at me, and I felt something inside me just snap. I put the baby down and just left. I walked to my car and drove to the 24-hour grocery store for a bottle of mouthwash. I sat in the back parking lot of our building and quickly downed half the bottle. S came down and snatched it from me, poured it out, and left. Of course, I just went and bought another, and I somehow ended up back in the apartment.

Well she ended up getting physical with me, and from my understanding, we had a little wrestling match, but I did not strike her. From my hazy memory, she blocked my exit from the apartment and I grabbed her wrist to push her aside. During all of this, her young daughter had called the police. 

I waited outside to get arrested, and I did, being charged with domestic assault. This incident was going to be the start of another downward spiral. I lost my reason for getting up in the morning, the kids, as I was not allowed around S or her kids, or my apartment. I don’t remember doing this, but I guess I went off on our worker about S, which I am still truly sorry about. Then I found out that CPS had come and taken the kids from S again, and that just compounded everything. 

The next few months are a haze. I went between my brother’s couch, my parents, sometimes my car, sometimes the park. I just drank all my money away, but my parents eventually helped me secure another apartment. During this time, S and I started seeing each other again, secretly, as I was still on conditions. On one of our backroad drives we did our ‘thing’ in the back seat, then she had some news for me. I remember the sense of deja vu. Yes, it is exactly what you think, she admitted to getting drunk with my brother and fucking him to hurt me.

You heard it right folks. The only two women I have ever been in love with both cheated on me with my own twin brother. That shit hurt, but I have since worked through it all.

Anywho, so I have the apartment, but I’m drinking like crazy. End up getting arrested two nights in a row for various minor things, which leads me to get evicted. You would think my parents would be finished helping me at this point, but nope! They fucking bought me a mini home instead. They said now I can’t get evicted and I’ll never be homeless. Sorta crying as I type this, sitting here in that very home sober and making them proud.

Well another girl, a friend from a while back, reentered my life at this point. Gonna say this was April of 2020. She has always wanted a relationship, but I have not. Drunk me would do anything to stay drunk though, and she helped supply me every day. This ‘relationship’ ended very suddenly on September 28, 2020, when she called 911 from my home. 

I will be the first to say I am an angry drunk a lot of the time. I remember smashing a few of my own things and screaming at her. But the bullshit stuff she had me charged with was out of this world. I woke up the next morning in the local holding cells, and I had that same sense of dread I have had many times before. They read me my charges while getting prepared for a court transfer. Domestic assault, assault by choking or strangulation, forcible confinement, and more. 

I remember talking with the cop on the way to the courthouse and being in disbelief of my charges, specifically forcible confinement. This woman weighed over 350lbs, and I am 180lbs with a physical disability…. The cop actually laughed about it.

So I get to talk to duty counsel, as my lawyer isn’t available, they suggest going on remand till my lawyer can do my bail hearing. That started 15 days in Burnside again, but not under normal circumstances. 14 of those days I was on a quarantine range. 23 to 24 hours a day in your cell, no books, no radio, only two TVs hanging in the range. This was pure fucking torture and I was blessed to get paper and pens from one of the guards. Suffice to say I did a lot of writing in there.

The first thing I did after getting out was log on here and start taking it seriously. Over the last eight months, I have done everything possible to stay sober. I have been involved with multiple counsellors, completed multiple group classes, and try to be involved here every single day.

Since then I received an absolute discharge for most of my charges, going through a local court focused on addictions issues, and the others I received only one year of probation. I have met an amazing new woman I am proud to call my girlfriend, and I have moved back into my own home.

I honestly can’t thank this community enough for supporting me through this latest chapter in my crazy life. I wouldn’t have gotten this far without having the daily support, as some days it is the only thing that stands between me and a bottle. I have also landed a great job as a writer for a publishing company, and for the first time I see a sense of purpose in my life again, and I can see a future.

Thanks so much for reading.",t3_nxz3wp
927,Bottling up feelings and not saying what I need to say,"I felt a lot of progress in the last few weeks. Since I was in therapy for a very long time I know how to look at my issues as objectively as it is possible for me. I got quite good at it over the years. 
Speaking my truth is something that is still very hard for me. I might have used alcohol (and self harm and starvation and drugs and men) to drown my own voice. Literally and figuratively. Or to cope with how much I have silenced myself. 
I had a fight with someone I really care about. A week ago. We triggered each other. It escalated. I apologized. I still feel bad. I know I am not perfect and I mess up sometimes... but I hate loosing people. It hurts so much. 

I thought a lot about reaching out. About the pros and cons... In the end I texted him. I told him, that I really hope we are okay. And I really hope that I get to see him before I leave for the new school in another town. Maybe that was stupid but I would have agonized about it for the next few days if I didn't reach out. I don't want to bottle things up anymore. I want to speak my mind and my heart, especially towards people I care about. I want to show up as I am. I know I still have work to do but I am willing to do it. I still want to show up. 

I grew up with three siblings and very opinionated parents. I know how to fight. I know how to apologize. I know that healthy relationships and friendships don't come without conflict. That intimacy doesn't come without conflict. That sometimes someone you love pushes all your buttons until you scream. That people you care about can really get under your skin. That love and friendship is messy sometimes. But also worth it. I love my complicated family and I love my complicated friend. I can't make him forgive me ... But I feel alright about reaching out. And telling him how I feel. I don't want to get into the anxiety spiral about how he maybe hates me forever now. Maybe he does. Maybe not. Either way. It's out of my hands.",t3_nyd8xd
928,Nearing the 2 week mark after years of use,"Hey there. Just wanted to share my story. For the past 3 to 5 years, i was putting a liter to a 1.5 liters of vodka straight into me daily. There wasnt a day i can recall i didnt have some drink that day. I always had at least one at some point. 

Then, this is going to sound weird, on memorial day i went to the er for a infection. I even took my last swig before the car ride over not knowing when my next one was (i wasnt driving btw). I got some blood drawn and a urine test and they saw i was severly dehydrated so they put me on a saline drip. I soon felt better. Then they told me they wanted to monitor the infection so i was kept in the hospital.

I was there for 3 nights and 4 days starting on may 31st. After that first iv bag they switched me over to a bag that takes 9 hours to go through called Lactated Ringers. Apparently its for more severe dehyration or medicial cases? I was on that iv drip 24/7 for 4 days straight.

The thing was, i had no urge for a single drink in there. I wasnt shaking or vomiting. Maybe a tiny sweating but that went away in 1 day. When i got out on the 3rd i had no urge for a drink, and it wasnt because i was on antibiotics, i literally just didnt care.

I kept a whole handle in my house for when i got home from the hospital too but i just tossed it after a day. Didnt care. Looking at it didnt even tempt me. Idk why. Maybe i got bored of drinking so much? I feel a lot clearer in the mind and have way more energy all day. 

Its been nearly 2 weeks now ive been sober and ive never been happier. I wonder if i didnt experience those bad detox symptoms ive heard of due to being on a iv drip during the process. If that makes sense? 

Being told i cant drink on antibiotics helps too. I dont want to make the infection worse and have to go back to the hospital, you know?",t3_ny5tde

933,I had a huge victory from not drinking.,"So a bit of context I work in IT most of the people in our office are gamers and into building models designing things as hobbies. Not many people in our office are outdoorsmen. Not saying all of IT is like that just my office and the 20 coworkers who work there. 

So Thursday night my phone rings from one of the big bosses. My managers manager. Who used to be my direct supervisor but I haven’t talked to him in months. So I immediately assume something is wrong and I caused the issue. 

I answer he says “hey man you got a minute?” I was like well here we go.  
He then says “hey man me and a friend have been planning this trip for months and he had to cancel last minute. Everything is paid for and all you gotta do is show up. We’re hiking the Gregory bald mountain in Tennessee and we’re leaving Monday morning to go. We have an empty spot now and I think you would enjoy it if you can’t make it I totally understand.” 

I got so excited I immediately said “let me ask my wife and I’ll call you this evening.” So I talked with my wife we worked out childcare and we are a go.

So I called him back and told him we were going and he was excited he then we hashed out the details. Nothing was said but I know that the reason I was invited is because I’m not a loose cannon anymore. He won’t have to worry about me getting drunk and being a royal pain in the ass. I’m so happy that this has happened. So I leave Monday at 6 AM to go on my first backpacking trip in years. Can’t wait! IWNDWYT",t3_nxi684

939,I made an achievement scoring system,"So, this might seem nerdy, but it motivates and clarifies things for me. Maybe it will do either for you too.

Let’s say you want to go a number of consecutive days while reaching a goal. For me, the goal is to spend the day/evening without drinking alone. Whatever your goal is, the number of consecutive days you achieve this goal corresponds to a simple level, from 0-16.

You are at Level 0 if you’ve never gone a day while achieving your goal. You are at Level 1 if you’ve made it 1 day. To go up a level, you have to double the days you’ve gone while meeting your goal.

Surprisingly, the normal calendar system matches this this system quite intuitively. And psychologically, we notice the passage of time in a [similar way](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting).

Here’s a chart to remember milestones:

Level 1 = 1 Day

Level 2 = 2 Days

Level 3 = 4 Days

Level 4 ~ 1 Week

Level 5 ~ 2 Weeks

Level 6 ~ 1 Month

Level 7 ~ 2 Months

Level 8 ~ 4 Months

Level 9 ~ 8 Months

Level 9.5 ~ 1 Year

Level 10.5 ~ 2 Years

Level 11.5 ~ 4 Years

Level 12.5 ~ 8 Years

Level 13 ~ 10 Years

Level 14 ~ 25 Years

Level 15 ~ 50 Years

Level 16 ~ A full life

Just getting to the bottom rungs is an achievement. A pattern of low to medium levels is an achievement. A high level is an achievement.

941,"People cant handle ""I dont drink""","People are shocked by people not drinking, I dont know why but it's true. Had a coworker tell me about how they went to the bar and how great of a time it was and how drunk they got. Kept asking me to go with them on the weekend. This conversation has happened multiple times. I usually just dont say anything mainly because I dont feel like explaining my sobriety to anyone, but I finally said ""I dont drink"" 
She looked at me in shock mixed with complete amazement and kinda just laughed indicating that maybe she thinks I'm just joking (why I dont know)... I said yeah I havent drank for almost a year now... she literally turned around and just walked away looking like a deer in headlights. She didnt know what to say, maybe because that's all she really has to talk about. I've listened to her stories and relate to them because I know that life all to well (and havent been done with it for very long yet)... but she just assumed and instead of being genuinely happy she showed disgust or some kind of lack of understanding which was really weird for me. Another thing,

Today...because its friday, a friend came in from out of town. Keeps bringing up how much beer he is getting. Texting about it and how he wants us to come by. I said not to buy too much cause I cant drink... the next thing he is asking ""why"",  but I'm just tired of making excuses so I felt the need to disclose ""I'm not drinking because I havent drank for almost a year and I'm going to keep going""....and the response? Instead of a good for you or a congrats, it was... ""you've changed"" a jab with humor, but also letting me know the disappointment in my choice of sobriety. I said ""absolutely"".

 I am so completely exhausted with trying to appease other people and save face that I think today was the last straw on the camel's back. I no longer think it's funny or cute or friendly jargon to be manipulated into feeling guilty for someone elses lifestyle decisions. I couldn't care less. I've fought very hard not to drink and If I decided to go back to it, I would do it on my own terms, not when someone else wants me to!  Super sick of social settings, social gatherings and overall cant find meaning in what people think is important. Quitting drinking has improved my spiritual life, my mental health, and my physical well being. I'm not willing to give it up. I guess I just need to clear out some skeletons in the closet and start telling people NO and not worry if they are offended by that.

 Alot of this experience so far has been a massive perspective twist. I feel like I took the red pill in the matrix and now reality is showing me what people value, their true colors, what my life was with and without alcohol and it's been eye opening to say the least.

 Anyway stay convicted in your sobriety! Dont let others push you around because if someone wants to backhand your healthy life decisions, that isnt friendly fire, its B.S.  IWNDWYT",t3_nxqu1b

I almost feel duty bound to be sitting outside with a beer ""making the most of the weather"" (in the UK, so good weather isn't as frequent as some other places). Not sure why drinking is so embedded into that activity for me, but it just seems an odd concept to sit out _without_ a beer!

Don't know if there was a point to this post, think I'm just feeling frustrated going against my programming. IWNDWYT!

I have been sooo busy with general world opening up events, and I am so proud today to say that I've done it all sober - I keep seeing this **""It wont be easy, but it will be worth it""** written everywhere and god do I believe it now.

It hasn't been super easy however I still feel like I'm just flip switched I don't want this stuff anymore. I really look at it with disgust, alcohol really slowed me down the last 10 years - I am so not allowing anything to fuck with the next 10 years of my life like that. 

I just went to the petrol station by my house and saw all the wine there (awful tastes like farts wine) and I just looked at it like uggh filth, those tiny bottles I'd try to buy to stop myself buying a second big bottle, the late night dashes at 9.55 to panic buy more wine before they stop selling at 10pm. 

*alcohol truly is disgusting*

Last night I went to a dinner at some friends, it was the first place I have been offered an alcohol free wine at someones house that I didn't have to bring myself and it was really nice! (the wife was breastfeeding so she was a sober gal like myself and they also have a neighbour who doesn't drink)

I felt like I was part of a squad with this neighbour, lol even though we've never met. It was nice to be at a dinner and not be the only sober person. It's also nice to hear that your friends have other sober friends. It's nice to see everyone on this sub and everyone I follow on instagram striving for something more than the 'norm'

We talk about how drinking is 'normal' but it's not, it's so fucking weird, people sitting around for hours on end drinking poison is not normal, or at least it shouldn't be.

Anyway with all of that I am just saying that even though I don't really have any IRL friends who are living their best sober lives, I feel like I do, because I get to come here everyday and hear about your good times and your bad times and I feel a great sense of belonging today :) 

Thanks my friends, I so will not drink with you today!

948,First time talking to therapist insights,"I've been seeking therapy for anxiety, drinking and sleeping issues for about a year and FINALLY had my first session the other day. For context, my drinking is 100 per cent related to self medication and being able to go to sleep. I do not drink too much at parties, and never drink during the day. 

My therapist had a few really wonderful insights that have cracked my brain like an egg and maybe you will relate to them. : )

1. I'm mentioning I'm getting more into fitness and really enjoy it, but its hard to reach my goals while drinking a bottle of wine every night. And I mention that I'm starting to take my career more seriously and looking better will help. He mentions those are connected, and I say ""yeah every part of my life would be better if I stopped drinking."" BRAIN CRACKED LIKE AN EGG. I've never articulated this so plainly. My life will be better if i quit drinking. My health, my vanity, my career, my mental health, financially, every part of my life will be better without drinking!
2. I mention that because of drinking and losing my job due to covid, my sleep schedule is insane and I never wake up before 1 pm. I say, I will usually try to drink in order to go to bed, so I can wake up earlier because otherwise I would lay in bed sober and not be able to sleep all night. And he says...well how is that working for your sleep schedule?  And I say its not...oh. My sleep schedule sucks and alcohol is not making it better....so stop thinking tonight's the night it will get better! 

Just wanted to share some insights I had. 50 mins with a therapist has completely changed my thinking and I'm so excited to continue this journey!",t3_ny1cc6
949,I had a little sober run and then my birthday happened.,I want to say I was hitting like 3 weeks sober. My coworkers wanted to take me out for my birthday. I accepted and figured I could just sip on a glass of wine. I was great with the wine but people started buying me shots. I couldnt bring myself to decline. I blacked out. In the morning I found myself in a strange house  with no recollection of the rest of the night. I didnt drive (thank goodness) but in the course of the evening my car was stolen. Obviously I have the police on the case and even more obviously Im no help to them. Im so embarrassed. Im upset. I thought I could handle it. Back to day one.,t3_ny4q57
950,Trying to break habits,"Made a trip to the big box hardware store. I like this one because a big box liquor store is in the same parking lot.
It was due to several posts on this sub that kept me driving past the LS and on to home, where I had a nice evening that I’ll actually remember. Feels good now, but it was a tough afternoon.

951,As I come unglued,"These can’t always be positive posts.

I quit drinking. Yet the effects of alcohol, chaos, and drama follow me. This is one of those times in life when I have realized that life as we know it can end in a moment. 

The first year of sobriety was hard. I ignored my mental health, convinced myself stopping drinking was going to be the fix to everything. But life throws these landmines despite our struggles.

I am glad I have had so much clean time under my belt. It is a good thing.

It is with a heavy heart that I am now in one of those stages of grief they talk about due to an alcohol related accident which destroyed two lives, two families, and the fallout is eating me and my family alive. Fair weather friends and those that can’t face who they really are have become apparent.

I hope none of you ever have to deal with this level of pain, rage, and profound loss.

I can’t handle my emotions, my feelings of anger, disbelief, I can’t sleep...I am racked with guilt and a debilitating grief of the death of a young girl, only beginning to live her life, whose death was allegedly caused by my best friend: the decision made to get behind the wheel of a car one night to drive home will haunt us now forever. 

My eyes leak unexpectedly and I find myself sobbing throughout the day, my heart hurts,  I cannot function. Dark thoughts - ever present - enter my brain. I feel like this will never end, but it has only just begun.

I have finally had to admit that I don’t have the strength to go through this by myself while simultaneously holding up the world. I am past the point where I can self correct. I have been in crisis for a while now before this happened- holding my head above water only because I have had to come up for air.

952,Hi! I've never been so encouraged as I have been reading this sub.,"Alcoholism runs in the family. My father has been in AA almost a year and a half and honestly, he has never been better. He's been a big inspiration for me to get sober.

My fiance and I have both been sober-curious on and off again because sobriety is just best for our mental health. When we drink, we both drink in excess and are not the best versions of ourselves to each other or to ourselves. We've done months of a time of sobriety, only to think we can allow ourselves one beer at a party, and boom - catch us stopping at 7/11 on the way home for a 6 pack and two bottles of bubbly.

A little over a month ago, a mental breakdown caused by hangover anxiety led to us both deciding to quit forever. No wiggle room. No special occasions. *Never again.*

We're both over the moon with how our mental health is now! We have started working out, we cook at home more often, our relationship is strong. The best part is every weekend after hanging out with friends, we wake up in the morning feeling refreshed, not anxious or hungover. We are in it for life and honestly, being fortunate enough to make this decision with my teammate and life partner has made things so easy. Also, finding this sub has made me realize how normal our decision is - I feel incredibly validated just reading through the endless stories. 

All of that to say, the only thing I miss about alcohol is the celebratory nature of a drink. I have my bachelorette coming up and I am confidant in my ability to stay sober, that said i still want to cheers with my friends before we go out! I still want to have something tasty in my hand at the bar!

We are exploring the world of spirit free cocktails thanks to the cookbook Good Drinks. I want to find a great brand of NA bubbly that looks pretty in a flute and we can serve at our wedding (there will be a number of sober people at our small wedding). I can drink soda water and lime all day, but I want something special for those special occasions! Any ideas?",t3_ny5ijb

Poker is fun with or without alcohol! I firmly believe people that are offended by others not drinking are trying to feel better about their own drinking habits.",t3_ny3ojy
955,Yep. Ok. Time to be done.,"Wow is all I can say about the last 6 days. I might be at my worst point physically and mentally in a long time. But for this moment, at 6am, I had grabbed one of the last drinks in the fridge and then put it back. I'm just gonna take today to recover instead of adding more pain. IWNDWYT",t3_ny4bel
956,Finally realized that enough was enough,"For a bit of context I'm 25 and I've been drinking alcohol since the age of 16. At first it was just the occasional beer or two on special occasions. Then it was with every other meal. Before I knew it I was rewarding myself with a drink everyday, and now I'm at the point where I've been regularly drinking without a break for the past 7 years. The problem is that you never realize you're stuck in the trap until it's too late. Alcohol abuse isn't a sudden process. It's like sitting in a pot of water as it slowly starts to boil. If you asked any of your friends if they drink more now than they did 5 years ago the answer would probably be yes, but it's so insidious in nature that we don't notice. 

Cut back to the present. I've been cutting back my drinking for the past few weeks, but after one dumb night I completely blew it. I can barely move because I spent the entire day throwing up to the point where I nearly passed out. I'm gulping down Tylenol because my head feels like it's about to explode, and the only thing that comes to mind is ""why am I doing this to myself?""

Today is officially my first day without alcohol and I'm really glad I came across this amazing community. I know it won't be an easy journey and there'll be hurdles, but at some point I needed to look at myself and just say ""enough is enough.""",t3_ny7bvs
957,"Overwhelmed today, and really want a drink.","The walls are closing in on me. I am moving 1000 miles away in 8 days and starting a new job while trying to wrap up my old jobs. I have two young kids to take care of, a 40 hour online course to take that I’m only 6 hrs into, a 32 hour M—F 9:30–4:30 online training session this week that just got sprung on me too.

I’m adding up the times and even if I go balls-to-the-wall with no breaks this week, I am still looking at a 90 hour work week, not including taking care of my kids, eating, sleeping, packing, dropping kids off at daycare, getting their new daycare set up for the summer, etc.

Plus I’m moving back into my old home 1000 miles away in ten days, but my one tenant says she hasn’t found a place to move yet, despite plenty of time to find one. She has moved in 3 squatters and the house is trashed. It looks like a Hoarders episode and I’ll probably have to get the sheriff to help evict them, and I’m sure they’ll get angry and destroy my things in the way out (house is furnished).

I’m walking from one quasi-nightmare into another one. I know it’ll be okay eventually but I the impulse to drink has been the biggest today since I got sober several weeks ago.

Even now I should be doing my testing/training and filling out new hire paperwork, but my phone keeps messing up and it won’t let me sign the w4 and I9 stuff. Keep getting an error. So I’m super frustrated and venting online, trying to choke down a panic attack while simultaneously keep myself from running to the store to grab cheap nasty wine.",t3_ny70od
958,"Day 40, mental illness, other stuff","Good morning, SD. I got more than 3 hours of sleep for the first time in weeks, so I feel amazing. I have Bipolar disorder type 1 and have been on a manic high for several weeks. I’m hoping the fact that I slept means I might be coming down. The mania can be fun in some ways, but it also means that I ruin my relationships and ignore my child — decidedly NOT fun. 

Today is Day 40 for me and I’m not sure why, but it feels like a big deal. I’m really proud to be here. I will not drink today. 

Yesterday was tough. I came home from picking my daughter up from school and the moment of setting my purse down and walking into the kitchen set off a major trigger of wanting to pour a drink. Thankfully I don’t have any alcohol in the house! I got through it, but it was a good reminder that I’m not cured of this — it will always be there, waiting to snatch me. 

I’ve begun redoing some things in my life — I’d like to take better care of my apartment and clean more often, I’ve been writing in my journal daily, I’ve been buying myself fresh flowers once a week. I’ve haphazardly started doing yoga, which feels great when I can force myself to get off the couch. 

Those first couple of weeks of sobriety made me think that all my problems were solved instantly. I was unstoppable. Now I realize that’s not the case. I still have all the same problems, but at least now I’m sober enough to deal with them. I have a lot of work to do on myself, and I finally made the call yesterday to get a therapist and start working on my issues. I’m excited. 

And finally, I get to see my new boyfriend tomorrow. We just started dating a week ago but things are going amazingly well. I am present for the first time ever, and able to be a good partner. He thanked me for always knowing the right thing to say, and I know that wouldn’t be possible if I weren’t sober with all of you here. Thank you all so much — I couldn’t do this without you.

959,I get the bronze medal!!!,"So... Ok, I know 8 days isn't like ""wow, so sober, such change"" but hear me out. I've only quit drinking longer than one week twice before. So, if my gold medal is 22/23 days, and my silver medal is around 12, then that makes this my BRONZE MEDAL SOBER STREAK!!! I feel like this time is the time. I have got motivation like never, ever before. It's life or death this time and I don't want to die, I want to be happy. I'm going to AA, I want that 30 day chip, and so on. I am buying books that I actually read (this naked mind was a good one), writing, listening to podcasts and I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY. I want this so bad. I don't know what's different this time. Maybe it's because in the last few years, after bad benders I get really suicidal and royally fuck my life up. I don't ever want to feel like that again.

963,I'm gonna check in every day until I hit a week.,"Good morning you beautiful people!

This is the morning of Day 7...by the time I lay my head on my pillow tonight I will have completed one full week of sobriety.

Tomorrow morning I plan to check in with a weekly recap with some thoughts about my journey thus far,
BUT for now, I thought I would share what has brought me to this point:  (sorry, it's long...feel free to skip this one.)

I was a ""good"" kid growing up, raised in a conservative Christian household. I didn't raise hell, got good grades, didn't do drugs, etc.  I purposefully did not drink alcohol until after I graduated high school, however, the first time I drank I got drunk.  I didn't like the feeling of being out of control, but the party atmosphere was fun.  After I left home and went to college I kind of went off the rails.  I never had a real taste of freedom before and I didn't know how to self regulate.  Since my late teens/early 20's I have always drank alcohol. Not every day, but very frequently.  And every time I drank I drank for the buzz.  To make matters worse, I never really picked up any positive coping mechanisms for stress, so I pretty much ate and drank my way through my 20's and 30's, steadily gaining weight.  Although I'm 6'2"" tall, hitting 300 pounds for the first time was a real wake-up call.  

In January of 2016 I resolved to get healthy.  Mind you,  I did not yet think I had a problem with alcohol,  I was just too fat,  so I quit drinking and started exercising and eating healthy.  I dropped 50 pounds in six months!  In July of that year,  my family went to Hawaii to celebrate my wife's birthday and my son's high school graduation.  I decided to let my hair down a little since we were on vacation after all.  I ate and drank what I wanted.  When we returned home I fell back into my old habits,  but this time with gusto!

I'm pretty certain I have not been sober for one week since that vacation. 

Let me put that in perspective, I have not been sober more than one or two VERY INFREQUENT days at a time in the last 5 years! I'm so disgusted by that.

Because my wife and I have good jobs, we can pretend that we just love life!  We're connoisseurs of good food, wine, craft beer, and bourbon!  What a lie.  This 'connoisseur' would kill a liter of bourbon in two nights,  no problem.   In fact, I usually had to restrain myself on day one to make sure I had enough for day two, otherwise I'd have to scramble to make sure I had enough extra beer or wine or whiskey to supplement it.

Did you ever have that secret fear you wouldn't have enough around to get you through the day, night, weekend, etc?  How do you rationalize to your spouse, kids, friends why you have to stop, yet again at the liquor store to pick up some beverage or another.  ""Oh, I had a rough day at work."" ""It's so-and-so's birthday.""  ""It's Friday!""  There's always something to celebrate. Always something to mourn.  Always a reason to drink away our pain. It just stops being cute after awhile and feels dirty.

And the hangovers!  What a miserable life, lying to myself day after day saying ""I feel like shit, I'm not going to drink tonight. ""  knowing that's a lie and already wondering what excuse I'll make to get drunk. 

If you've made it this far, thank you...and I'm sorry for rambling. Here's what I want you to know:

I've never admitted this to anyone, not even my wife...but I am an alcoholic.

I use alcohol to dull the pain of life...but I've discovered even the pain of life is sweeter than the constant zombielike existence I've tricked myself into.

I'm getting off this crazy train for good.

966,11 Months Sober,"11!!

I lurked this page for a couple years before I felt ready to see if I could abstain from alcohol. I would be alone drinking at the bar, pissed about something, and read strangers’ stories on here. Everyone here seemed so strong, and I told myself that I could never be that strong because frankly, I truly didn’t think I had it in me.

I was drinking nearly a bottle of whiskey most nights during the first three months of the pandemic. I began to feel like my body was finally breaking and that I needed to do something. June of 2020 was when I was finally ready to try to get a handle on it, but July 11th is when it finally clicked for me: I needed to change my relationship with alcohol or my entire future (mental/physical health, relationships, career) would continue to decline. 

So I came here, reset my badge, and lurked regularly. I downloaded a daily sober check-in app that also has a community board with a bunch of strangers all trying the same thing. I told myself and my friends, “you know, I may drink again in the future, but I just don’t want to drink today.” I bought Annie Grace’s book This Naked Mind in case I needed something to help distract. I then slowly started to open up to my friends and even my family about my progress. As my days racked up I felt stronger and empowered, like I was one of the folks on here I once envied.

Great news, I still feel strong! There are still urges and triggers but I experience them differently now: I can stop my brain and think through the reason behind the urge. “I’m not gonna drink at it.” 

I also do acknowledge now that I should never drink again. “Oh I broke that button,” I say to coworkers and friends. No one seems to mind. As others here say, I’m much more aware of how many people around me just don’t drink. The community support definitely helps.

I am happier without whiskey. I don’t need beers and chain smoking to enjoy a campfire with friends. I may mess up in the future, but I know I’m not gonna drink today. Thank you to everyone in this community for your support and for sharing your honest stories. You have helped me unleash my inner strength or whatever, and I’ve actually changed my life for the better. Thanks for reading!",t3_nxxtvf
967,Dealing with Triggers,"This is my first Saturday morning in a while where I haven’t felt like shit. I enjoy getting up early and being present for my family. 

However, I’m worried about triggers. For example, my wife wants to hit a patio for our wedding anniversary next weekend. My kids will be at my parents’ overnight and I’m worried about triggers when we go out for dinner and enjoy the patio. 

I’m also worried about our yearly week long trip to her parents cottage. 

I understand the whole one day at a time thing, but I’m just curious how all of you “long timers” dealt with these triggers and managed to stay sober and enjoy the moment.",t3_ny40km

973,It just gets worse and worse...,"I have previously been a member of this community and have shared similar “it gets worse and worse posts.” I may have deleted them or I may have posted on some other profile. Well, for those of you who have months and years and even multiples of days and weeks, I am here to tell you that it indeed gets worse and worse. To keep it very concise, here are the key milestones of the last 2 years that are all driven by alcoholism and my peculiar focus on self-destruction: 

- relapsed after ~two years sober 
- scared shit out of family 
- scared shit out of girlfriend 
- ruined Thanksgiving 
- sent home from work for being drunk at work 
- spent Christmas in a treatment center 
- spent New Year in treatment center 
- back to work
- relapsed - drank for a week in a hotel and landed in ICU + rehab again 
- return to work, demoted (at the end of the prior year I was in line for a huge promotion) 
- resentments
- relapse, rehab again 
- discharge and get fired “for expiring FMLA” - obviously it’s really because they just couldn’t deal with me anymore 
- go home to girlfriend and work my ass off to get new job - get new job - start new job 
- relapse - kicked out of living situation - major bender - treatment - bender on way back from treatment 
- readmit to treatment - somehow continue drinking by leaving the facility then just leaving early 
- reach out to “friend” from rehab and spend the next six months blowing my savings and some of my retirement on this great new thing called heroin that I had never tried and would not have sober
- that “friend” proceeded to introduce me to some of the shadiest people I’ve ever know and money evaporated on drugs like it was nothing 
- my ex girlfriend lost a decent amount of my stuff somehow in moving my shit out while I was gone and I used that to keep the fire going but it was all because I had started drinking again 
- I’ve been to detox twice in the last six months and finally have put together 7 days without alcohol and heroin: I’m significantly worse for wear, my job is on the line (I somehow still have it), and there have been numerous pieces of terrible decision making along the way 
- my brother got married and I was supposed to be the best man and instead I was uninvited from the wedding 

Tl;dr: I don’t know that I understood what it meant by it just gets worse. I think I might now. Drinking indeed has dissolved everything else I’ve ever valued. It’s led me down paths that I never thought that I would go down. My family is fed up with me. What’s worked so far this week is that the detox center I went to did not use narcotics for detox and they use ketamine infusion therapy. And that combination has somehow given me the slight slight amount of perspective shift that has allowed me to grab some hope and make the decision to reach out to others for help and to do things like make this post.",t3_nxrevv

980,Jailx3,"Alcohol sent me to jail three times. I’m only recently alcohol free after stopping the ever on going fantasy of moderation and ending in far from fabulous “functioning alcoholic” benders. I have just returned home from a friends birthday party. First event with a group of people since march 2020. The night started off well enough and I have my kombucha, so I’m good. The birthday girl and I are discussing how many days I am without alcohol and she mentions the longest she’s been without alcohol is 24 days. Without missing a beat, we THEN started talking about when we’d drink together again. Like, I fucking started planning on when that day happens in the not to distant future. This last bender I dodged jail. I know I did because of how scared I felt coming out of the craziest first week of Ianuary. I was putting myself in totally bad situations and was completely irresponsible. Dude, I have so much anxiety even thinking about drinking again. It’s so easy my friend. I’m terrified I might drink again because how easily I convinced my future self. People sharing their stories helps me recognize that anxiety I’m suffering right now is from what I know results from drinking. Jail sucks. Jail fucking sucks. Alcohol has never done me any favors.

I am on the other side of the world for the next 2 months and I don't know what to do. I have told other family members and I feel like they are not taking it seriously. 

She is a single mother with a young daughter and I don't know what to do?",t3_ny1irs
986,Sinister feelings?,"Sorry guys I’ve never posted on here before. But I started drinking roughly 6 months ago and it’s gotten to the point of having been drinking 1 litre vodka a day/day and a half for 2 or more months now. I’m a 24 yo female, I’m so sure both my physical and mental health are not coping with it (wow what a surprise) but I’m meant to be seeing an I take worker and then a psychiatrist on the 16th and 17th of this month respectively. 
Fuck sorry I’ve gone so off track from the main point I was tryna make; 
Am I the only one who experiences feeling dark or sinister energy during alcoholism in general? I can’t say for sure because I’ve never noted if it’s when my drinks are wearing off given I’m awake (if I’m asleep, totally different story which I’m so used to at this point but that doesn’t take from how horrible that purgatory state of dreaming/false awakenings are. And hearing voices too like fuck,
Sorry back to the point, am I the only one who experiences this dark, alternate reality, often times sinister feelings that I’ve never felt before until getting 6 months deep into 30 shots of vodka a day type addiction) it’s so scary and I feel so alive, I’m booked in with a detox/rehab centre for evaluation (I’m in Victoria Australia if anyone wondered, I don’t know if you call this stuff different things wherever you are), but sorry, my point was I’n hanging in sooo bad for that but at the same time (as in the mean time cause it’s still a fair few days to go till I can be inpatient. Am I fucking crazy? Or has anyone else experienced this? It’s like a never ending state of purgatory every night",t3_ny1ijm
987,I'm 57 days sober,"Life really is good without alcohol.

I spend my days doing fun activities, I'm happy to be at home relaxing and I'm fine with being bored, I feel like I've managed to get over a fair few emotions now and not feel triggered.

I'm consistently taking my anxiety meds and although they may need tweaking just a little they have certainly improved me, I sometimes can't believe I used alcohol to give me a quick relief from anxiety and depression, I have 0 depression and my anxiety is mostly under control.

I'm still smoke free which is just a relief for me.

My relationships with my friends are getting better and I've been open and honest now with what I'm doing in terms of taking care of myself and what I struggle with, everyone is super supportive.

I'm able to get through my days without thinking about drinking, I don't avoid thinking about it at all it just doesn't bother me, I don't see alcohol in my life or my evenings anymore and it doesn't have the same connection that is used to.

Anyway here's to a sober life.",t3_nxqofu
988,10 weeks sober!,"I am so happy I have made it this far. I still have cravings here and there but I am sticking strong. 

I started a new job and everyone talks about drinking after work... I don't miss it, but what happens when they find out I don't drink? I feel so awkward and don't want to bring it up for fear that they will judge me.",t3_nxv4dh
989,Thank god I’m back,"Pretty awful relapse and I’m feeling disgusting today. But I’m glad to be back here. Pushing through the sweat and pain but grateful to be creating accountability again. 

Thanks for being a community I can rely on.",t3_nxr43t
990,Has anyone read The Barefoot Investor?,I cant tell if its about finance or a book about glamourising the use of alcohol?,t3_ny69j5
991,First real milestone and it came out of nowhere,"33 days for me.  Not sure why this one suddenly stuck out as a milestone for me- but it did.  Wasn’t even thinking about day 30- I was just living life.  

I did probably over 1000 “day 1’s, day 3’s, day 10’s” - every time -counting the days.   - this time- this time I knew it was forever.  I wasn’t counting.  I just happened to look in on my counter and was like “dang!” 😆 I passed day 30!

I don’t post much because literally everything my brain can think to ask has literally been asked- Many, many times over-I’m a big fan of the search function-but still this sub has been instrumental in my recovery.  Thank you all for sharing. 

I learned that the strange high blood pressure feeling I would get was actually alcohol withdrawal- not just my meds not working 

I learned that I’m not an angry, bitchy- person by nature- it was alcohol withdrawal.

I learned that it gets worse for a bit but it will get better- and embrace the suck

I’m not a snowflake- I’m not special with my addiction - I can’t justify using- that’s just my addiction talking.  Many of my “rationalizations” were actually just my addiction talking

I know I have a long way to go - but

992,Asking for a bit of help if you can spare it,"In my determination to celebrate a year with the flare it deserves, I've somehow created a bit of a goal or ""finish line"" type image. I don't know if there have been more posts recently about successful moderation and the benefits of alcohol, or maybe they're just standing out to me now. All of this to say that this week has felt like I'm slogging uphill in the mud. And I'm getting a little tired.

Where I thought I had a support system... Let's just say I was mistaken. While I knew this a year ago, I knew I was on my own, having to face that again after having this illusion of safety... Hurts. 

So hello internet strangers. Lend me some of your strength, please. Remind me what I'm doing here. Tell me I've got this.",t3_nxwa80
993,Beating Myself up for eating junk food,Been trying to be healthier while quitting booze and I always eat too much/eat sweets and go over my calorie limit for the day. I’ve been sober for 6 days (counter is wrong) and getting annoyed at myself,t3_ny0mrg
994,"16 days, not feelin it.","I honestly become annoyed and angry reading all the happy posts about how great people feel not drinking. My experience is the opposite. 
I am miserable, irritable and an absolute awful person to be around. 
Not entirely true. I am fine at work. Happy, joking, productive. Probably because I never drank there. But as soon as I come home? Forget it. 
I don’t want to be around anyone or do anything. If I could just sleep I would. 
Anxiety and depressed despite being on multiple meds for it. 
My counselor only tells me “you’re stronger than you think” and it’s the last thing I want to hear and does not help. Don’t tell me it gets better, don’t tell me I’m strong. 
I want to drink. Only reason I’m not is because I made the mistake of taking Antabuse for a week. Been off for a week now but still too scared to test it.",t3_nxqakh
