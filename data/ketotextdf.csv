2,"Keto transformation.. Over 77LB / 35kg gone, and now a semi athletic body from flabby!!","https://imgur.com/a/Fce07sf

HI all, hopefully I'm doing this right., 

I'm celebrating 15 months of keto and shredding down to 16.x% bodyfat from well over 30%+

SW : 220LB / 99.8KG
CW : 139LB / 63.1KG
BODYFAT : 16.X%

I've gone from wearing 34 size pants to 28 which are now loose.

Calorie intake : initially 1600 per day, however when I started weight training about 3 months ago I've boosted it to 1900 calories

My first ever attempt at getting fit, and I think I'm nailing it! Could never have done it without keto, I went from eating pies and takeaways every day, to learning the value of a calorie, cooking my own food every meal and learning how to be happy with myself.

3,"36 days, 15.2 pounds gone!","Good morning Keto peeps. This is my third attempt at Keto in my life and I would say my most successful. I'm using carb manager and Lose It! to track everything I eat. It's not my fastest weight loss, by far, but I feel more confident and have more energy than I have with doing it in the past. I'm focusing more on being active and eating clean. I even have a treadmill at home this time!!!

Slow and steady wins the race, right?! I started at 255.0 pounds. Goal weight is 140 pounds. I'll get there eventually. :) This time I plan on maintaining a keto lifestyle once I reach goal. 

Just wanted to say ""Hello!"" (again) and introduce myself (again).",t3_o157o7
4,"Year 2 Update - Slow Progress, but getting there. (Aka, COVID sucks)","Hey everyone! What a crazy year! 

This is an update of my post from this time last year: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/h9qws0/one\_year\_later\_i\_dont\_even\_remember\_what\_i\_used/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/h9qws0/one_year_later_i_dont_even_remember_what_i_used/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

When I made that original post I was a little bit nervous to make it. I was proud of what I had accomplished, sure. But never did I imagine the responses that I would get from you guys. To know that my accomplishments would impact so many of you, truly felt amazing! 

So... I figured I would give an update. 

I've kept going. I knew originally that I had made a major lifestyle change and would never go back. And honestly, I think that's what kept me going throughout the last year. It was a crazy year of gyms closing, working out at home, gyms opening, stress at work, and COVID meltdowns (only one I swear). But I stuck with it. 

If this year has proven anything to me is that even if that scale chooses not to move, it doesn't mean your not making progress. Every day that goes by, every little battle against food that you win, is a step in the right direction. 

I've had the opportunity to grow as a person, to discover what fitness and health truly mean to me in my life, and to figure out all the little specifics about how my body works. It's been a truly eye-opening experience. 

So how did I do? 

Well, when I weighed in this time last year I sat just above 230lbs and as of today, I'm sitting at 225lbs, which seems like I didn't do anything. But here's the thing, I went from 22% body fat percentage to 18.3%, which looks like this: (Warning guy in underpants)

[https://imgur.com/a/Tj3Wg0K](https://imgur.com/a/Tj3Wg0K)

I feel more confident, stronger, healthier, and happier than I ever have before. I wish I could have spent my entire life up to this point feeling like this. I truly don't even acknowledge my old life, it's just where I am now and where I am going. 

I had no idea the difference I was making in my body day over day, especially when that scale didn't move for MONTHS on end. But when you stack it up side by side as I have it's truly crazy. 

I want to encourage everyone to do this, stack your progress photos up, see the changes in your life. Become your own cheerleader, because I promise you that you're doing amazing! More amazing than your giving yourself credit for! 

The last two photos are a bit of a personal brag. 

The first is me in the same under armor shirt from when I was 21, to 2 years ago at 28 and then finally 2 days ago. It boggles my mind that I've made such a massive shift. I feel better and look better than I did when I was 21! I don't even know how that's possible.

And the last one is right before the gyms closed for the second time. I've gotten a small view of what I can accomplish and I'm committed to getting there. 

I hope this post has a fraction of the impact that my first one did! You are all an inspiration and I want every single one of you to keep going! Keep fighting for your health and for your future. Let's continue to change the world together!

Thank you all!",t3_o1hkuz

7,Better together and with support,"February 8th 344 lbs, June 14th 289 lbs. been reluctant to try keto but after a recommendation from my cardiologist I finally went to go see a weight loss Dr with my wife. We both started keto that day. What a kick in the teeth. Gave our children (they are all moved out) all the carbs in the house that day(probably $800-$900 in food) got the keto flu in the first few days, listened to the doctor and kicked it fast and are doing great. Most of my coworkers started keto within a few days of when we started and we support each other. Between my wife and I we are down about 95 lbs. This is much easier when you have support and maybe a little peer pressure!",t3_o1km9t
8,2 months in and it doesn't even feel like a diet! 10kg down (22lb) and I enjoy awesome bread every day ;D,"**EDIT:** Recipes are scattered in the comment section, apologizes if it looks messy :) Really appreciate all the interest tho, you people are great!

Down below I will link just a couple photos of food that makes keto lifestyle completely normal for someone who grew up eating minimum half a loaf of bread daily (e.g. my SO and myself). I'm sure plenty of you here can relate, and same goes for sweet tooth people.

Both of us (28M, 28F) lost about 10-12% of our body mass over past 2 months and it feels so damn good when your extra chin skin isn't the first thing you notice in the mirror. We always had a habit of healthy eating but also eating way too much. I guess it's hard to be a foodie if you won't give your tummy the same satisfaction that you give to your eyes.

Our main approach was to cut the usual (bakery, pasta, rice, sweets) and to try to find the best possible substitutes for those (mainly bread). And the whole new world of cooking and baking opened and I'm so grateful for that. Lasagnas with zucchini layers instead of pasta, burgers in our heavenly delicious buns, making spaghetti out of zucchinis, baking brownies, snack bars, cheesecakes ... list goes on.

[https://imgur.com/a/S72n3Rw](https://imgur.com/a/S72n3Rw)

Quick note for food in photos (and my apologizes if photo quality doesn't do them justice):

\- buns are around 3g net carb each (and 20 grams of protein!)

\- chocolate snack bars less than 2g net carb (idk why I say chocolate when its dark cocoa used)

\- brownies sub 4g of net carb (sadly unlike normal brownies these did get dry 4th day or so)

If you have any questions about the recipes I'd gladly share in the comments! Also, one advice to everyone that is considering going on a diet: Do take before photos, no matter how low you think of yourself, no matter how horrendous you think you look. I really regret not doing that because whenever I stumble on old random photos it really does give a confidence boost and a kick forward.

Keto on my friends! :)",t3_o1f8zt
9,PSA - What I've learned from 3 keto journeys,"This is my 3rd time ""doing keto"" over the last 7 years or so. The previous 2 attempts led to significant weight loss, but I always gained back more than I lost - and very quickly. This was due to two fundamental errors in my approach. 

1. Like many others, I misunderstood the purpose of being fat-adapted and never paid any attention to my total caloric intake. I wrongly assumed fat adapted = fat loss. (Peter Attia covers this really well in the latest Time Ferriss episode). Because I was naturally active - walking all over campus, working out regularly, cooking in professional kitchens, etc., I was able to easily burn more than I took in because I cut out all the sweets and just didn't have time to be home bored and snacking all the time. 

2. When I fell off the wagon, I fell hard. Seriously, once I slipped once and had a piece of cake or some sour candy or movie theater snacks, it was all over. Even worse, because I had fully accepted that eating plenty of fat was good, I kept shamelessly putting away every slice of bacon in arm's reach and loaded up on butter, mayo, and all the other fats without any carb or calorie restriction. Bottom line - I lost 20 lbs on keto each time, very quickly, and rewarded myself by gaining back 30. End result: up 40lbs from my best weight during keto

 In the interim I tried slow carb, but found myself living for the cheat day and feeling worse than ever because the inflammation from all the crap I ate one day a week. Weight watchers points lasted about 4 days (I was hungry ALL THE TIME). 

So here I am, giving keto a 3rd go. It's been easier in some ways, largely die to how much better keto snacks have gotten in the last couple years. But harder in others. I'm not shedding 5-10 lbs in any week. In fact, I e never fluctuated less on any eating plan. I'm seeing weight loss of maybe a lb a week. At first, this was discouraging and made me want to quit (I'm a dopamine addict and wasn't seeing that instant gratification on the scale). But ultimately the slow weight loss helped me focus on the other benefits of keto. When eating the SAD I am plagued by inflammation and constant joint pain, which is virtually non-existent on keto. I also don't get shaky and hangry nearly as often as I did on a high carb diet. Now I can go out and tolerate waiting to get home if ginger strikes, rather than grabbing whatever easy calories are within arm's reach. 

I feel better about this time around, mainly because I've finally accepted it as a long term lifestyle, rather than a quick fix for a little extra flab. Sure, I have my moments when I try to rationalize a way out because I want to eat mashed potatoes and sour patch kids (not together), but I came up with a rule that's working so far. If I decide I want to quit keto, I have to wait 24 hours to act on it. This has seriously put my instant gratification monkey in check, and gives me time to reflect on why I'm on this journey in the first place. 

Sorry for the long post, but hopefully someone relates.

TL;DR: 

1. Keto isn't a substitute for eating mindfully - calories still matter. 

2. If you decide keto isn't right for you, leave behind excessive fat intake when you switch back to carbs for fuel

3. The scale is not the most important metric for long term success on keto. Focus on how you feel overall.",t3_o18r3t
10,Keto Tic-Tac Trap,"Today is day 3 of me being on Keto, and I had a job interview in the morning. I stopped at the gas station to buy some tic-tacs to freshen up my breath a bit.  I ate exactly 3 of them, before I realized that these tiny things probably had loads of sugar in them. When I checked the nutritional facts, however, I saw that they had ZERO carbs and ZERO sugar in each tic tac. I felt that this was suspicious, as they certainly tasted like they had sugar- so I turned to the internet. It turns out that each tic-tac has about .52 grams of carbs (but Big Tic-Tac is allowed to round this number down on the nutritional facts) , so if you eat a whole box of them (38) you will consume roughly 20 carbs. Watch out for this one, and be suspicious of any small item that claims zero carbs.",t3_o1kpg4

15,10 months of keto and 140 lbs down,"Progress posts have always been inspiring so I thought I'd share my own success story (so far!).

Started keto and 16:8 IF hardcore on 8/11/20 at 6'1"" and 362lbs; cut out all sugar, all carbs, and all substitutes for two months before reintroducing artificial sweeteners (I never knew sugar-free soda could actually taste GOOD!)

Naturally transitioned towards OMAD as hunger subsided. Slowly introduced exercise in February with a stationary bike, rowing machine, free weights, and walks.

As of this past week I've reached the 140-pounds lost mark and am still inching ever towards my goal. I haven't been this weight since probably around 2009 and honestly didn't think I could get here again. I still have more to lose and it gets harder the closer I get to my goal but healthier habits are here to stay!

Also keep in mind my results are not typical and I was morbidly obese when I started. Never compare yourselves to others! KCKO!

I‚Äôve hit a plateau because I‚Äôve just been teetering between the 209s and the 207s for a couple months now. And I know it‚Äôs because of what I eat. I do count my calories and I am ususally eating 500 less daily but it‚Äôs counter productive cuz pretty much my daily diet is 60% carbs. We don‚Äôt have a lotta healthy things in our fridge and I comfort eat whether I‚Äôm sad or just bored. I need to get back into light walking tho, when I did I was burning about 640 cals a day which is good. I wanna tell my parents I wanna try the cyclical keto diet but everytime i bring it up they say ‚Äúoh you don‚Äôt need a diet you just need watch what you eat in portion which ofc is try to some degree btut it doesn‚Äôt really matter when pretty much everything I‚Äôm putting in my body is unhealthy and full of carbs right?

Meeting some people at a mall today where probably the only food will be at a food court. I might just skip eating but might feel some pressure to get something. 

So I'm trying to remember what I read here before about which places are best to order a bunless hamburger from. I'm thinking it was McDonald's and burger King but not sure.

- added - I'm trying to avoid seed oils too, that could have been one of the issues with some places, although that's not really a keto issue

- update - this mall has virtually no place to eat. Just panda express and a Philly cheesesteak place and I'm lactose intolerant!  Could probably just get meat with the cheese or bread though. One or more places look closed. Probably pandemic related.",t3_o17yrx

20,Dealing with keto bowel issues,"I have poor gastric motility/slow emptying syndrome. Since I have been doing keto (late February) I have been so constipated I've given myself bleeding hemorrhoids and an anal fissure (trust me you don't EVER want to get an anal fissure). Fiber - especially cruciferous vegetables and berries, but even fiber powders and supplements - binds me up horribly so it's not a solution for me like it is for most other people. Does anyone else have keto constipation who has a solution for it other than eating more fiber? My GI doc has told me to go back to eating soft foods that digest easily but she's talking like pasta and bread and potatoes and bananas and considering I'm type 2 diabetic that's not really an answer either. I can't live on eggs and chicken, but they're about the only thing I have left since red meat seems to be bothering my bowels as well. I'm allergic to seafood, soy, and nuts, so there go 3 other protein sources. I drink about 2 liters of water per day, I'm not supposed to go any higher as I have chronic congestive heart failure.",t3_o1dccf
21,Macro help needed for a skinny fat!,"Hi, I‚Äôve been on keto for about 2 years 52F SW52/CW45. I searched high and low and many are saying to keep going on keto. My current macros are C 13.1g, P 66.2g, F 81.5g and 1051kcal suggested by CarbManager. 

I‚Äôve reached my GW of 47kg within a few months of starting keto and kept going on and off to keep my weight below 46kg. 
My body fat was 32% before my keto and dropped to around 26-27% according to my Omron scale and staying this way for more than a year now. 

I started to exercise regularly about 4 months now. Usually HIIT or some kinds of strengthen exercises with either following Sydney Cummings or Lilly Sabri on YouTube 30-60min a day for 5-6/week. I walk on the treadmill about an hour 2-4 times a week. 

I checked the macro calculator here and also keto gains macro calculator. According to ketogains calculator, my BF% is 19% -22% and I think it‚Äôs pretty close to how my body looks now compared to their photo references though I still have small muffin top I love to lose. 

Please help me re-set my macro for the body fat loss. The macros suggested by carbmanager, keto calculator(r/keto), and ketogains calculator are all different. 

Thank you!",t3_o1jaa7
22,Question about macros.,"I just calculated my macros using a free keto calculator and now I need to understand how is it possible to consume consume 128g of protein daily and not go over 512 calories for protein? A chicken breast has approximately 200 cal and 25g of protein, therefore if I want to get my protein from this source I will max out my daily calories before I hit my daily protein needs right?

This would be the same question but for the fat portion of the macros below. I hope I am just over complicating things.

**Carbs**\-------108---------------------27

My doctor had zero confidence i could lose weight. She had never met me before and didnt know that i've done it in the past, but assumed that it's impossible and offered gastric bypass as an option--which i refuse to even consider. I told her keto would work for me, because i've done it before (but struggled to stay on it longer than 6 months), and she seemed unaware of what keto meant, but described a diet i should follow that's just like keto ""Cut out all the sugar and bread!""  


It's insane the difference 20 pounds makes. Bending over. Working. Playing with the kids--heck, even SLEEPING is different (how much easier it is to roll over, for example). The pain in my legs has vanished.   


It feels good.   


This time, my diet partner has commit to keeping me on this for 12 months. She's aiming to get me to 220 (my goal weight--the weight you can be allowed to skydive/tandem skydive). I have not weighed that little since 7th grade. Whew.",t3_o108mh

27,Help!! Feeling destructive and angry but also feeling nothing on keto. Lack all empathy.,"Hi team,

I had started keto years ago and was on it for six months. I had to stop because my body felt very heavy (I was eating very clean and the perfect amount of calories for my body) and even though my mood swings stopped, I also felt nothing - no happiness, no sadness, totally flat. Major things happened in my family during this time and I couldn‚Äôt even cry - that‚Äôs how bad it was. No joy, no laughter, no empathy. I was almost cold and cruel. I‚Äôm not sure what happened or why that was. 

I stopped and everything came back - I felt thawed and not suppressed or frozen and icky. Now I‚Äôm back on keto and experience the same thing as I did before. Most people I know on keto feel really empathetic and spiritually inclined; I‚Äôm basically dead and like a zombie and very destructive - no empathy, no tears, nothing. I feel destructive,If anything at all. Any idea why? Anyone else have this experience?

Edit: I do consume electrolytes; I‚Äôve played around w my carb load and nothing seems to help. I also do consume fish almost daily for underlying mental health issues.",t3_o1ch39
28,Dead simple keto meal plan,"Somebody recently was quizzing me about simple meal plan to do keto, and be healthy. (The healthy bit was requested after in all seriousness I told them that the simplest keto is eat nothing but bacon‚Ä¶) I‚Äôve played with different plans over the years of off and on keto‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve come up with what I feel is a simple keto meal plan that is nutritionally complete, and reasonably healthy. 

The one caveat is that it does hit the more moderate 40 net carbs, rather than the strict 20 net carbs. But after a couple of weeks of strict keto many will remain in ketosis on 40g net carbs and if not then a person‚Äôs vegetable/fat allocation could be adjusted. One more caveat‚Ä¶ haha, I know some keto purists might also find fault with the amount of protein. I have not found that this level of protein has an effect on ketosis in my personal experience- ymmv.

Nutritionally speaking it doesn‚Äôt completely meet the RDAs for B1(84%), Biotin(70%), Calcium(64%) and Zinc(87%). Also, eating the same thing every day is arguably less healthy than having a variety of foods. This gives you not only adequate amounts of omega 3 and 6 fats but also in the appropriate ratio. It should also in theory (and in my recent experience) prevent keto-flu because it has high and varied electrolytes from whole foods‚Ä¶ FWIW.

30,I might be doing something wrong?,"I am a 5'3"" female. The last week of December I was 189lbs. I began eating only lunch and dinner and they consisted of a seasons steak or grilled chicken, half a plate of broccoli or green beans or similar and a glass of frozen berries blended in water. I averaged around a five pound weight loss a week. After a couple weeks, I added a dinner out a week, scared I couldn't maintain weight if I ever at other food. I felt great! So much energy, not hungry ever. 

By mid March, I wanted to add in exercise, get in shape and tone up. This was not enough calories, so I switched to keto. I downloaded Carb Manager to track and continued weighing my food and keep the once a week dinner out. I started with only 10 minutes on the elliptical every other day and the other days, simple arm exercises with 5 lb weights and leg exercises.

From mid March until now, my exercises have not progressed, I am only down about 10 lbs and am a lot lower in energy by afternoon. I have continued drinking 80-100 oz of water a day. I am not figuring out what I should be adjusting here. At minimum, I want more energy to increase my exercise.  I am currently at 135 and between sizes, trying to hold off buying the much needed new summer clothes until I completely fit the next size down, only about five pounds away to feel comfortable in that size.",t3_o1cy5b

33,Worried about muscle loss,"Hi gang,

I have been doing keto about 50 days. I'd say after the initial 10 pounds, I've been losing about 2.5 pounds a week. I would say I am doing fairly strict keto, but the only macro tracking I do is to make sure my meals have less than 10% calories from carbs. Maybe once a week I will have a keto junk food (like peanut butter cups branded as keto, with sugar alcohol and fiber in them), or a few drinks (liquor + no calorie mixer). I have found foods with a small amount of sugar (like peanut butter) feel a lot better than artificially sweetened foods.

I have been fairly active, and while I do get a big energy boost after aerobic activity, I don't really feel like working out. I generally used to enjoy the challenge, but it just seems so hard on keto. I am certainly more active right now than I have been recently, with about 4 days of sports or group class, and a couple days with a lot of steps.

I have always been muscular and enjoyed sports, but I started keto because I had accumulated a lot of excess fat. Weight and pant size reduction have been great. **However, I am starting to feel weaker, and perhaps that my muscles look smaller, as well.**

I also feel like I have a lot of flab and organ (belly) fat still. Maybe I was bigger than I thought when I started, but yeah.",t3_o1e084

35,Keto for brain performance,"I'm currently studying for one of the hardest, if not the hardest, test that I'll ever take in my life. The USMLE Step 1 (It's around 7 hours of deep concentration).

I've read here that you should not try to get into keto if you're very close to exams because of the difficulties of the transition, keto-flu, etc. In my case, however, I plan on taking the exam on late november to december (2021), and I'm already studying for it since november (2020).

I certainly don't like the idea of ""loosing"" a week of my studies, because I'm in a very good rhythm since the beginning of my preparation, but I also think that maybe the high is worth the pain.

I alraedy have great habits of sleep, exercise and stress management being my diet the point at which I think I could use the most improvement.

**So the question is:** Is the transition worth it just for **cognitive performance** (I'm satisfied with my weight and I don't have any health condition), or is this another ""big project"" that would require a lot of dedication from my part (I've heard that falling out of ketosis is pretty easy, and then you have to start all over again).

Is the reward of this project being worth a try? I just want to be on my A game.

41,Keto Veteran Lands in ER for dehydration!,"So, talk about going idiot lol. Anyone who has been here a while knows I have been keto over 2 and a half years, and I am a ketoade fanatic. 

As in I drink diluted ketoade instead of water, have since day 1. And I track it. Always. 

Welp, in a series of purely idiot moments because I have been dealing with other issues, I ended up going to the ER today. And it turned out I was dehydrated.

My mistakes: last week the weather turned here in helena montana and it got hot. Not as hot as Tucson but hot, mid 90s. 

And though I started feeling a little odd, I had other things on my mind, so since I didn't have overt symptoms I kept my standard ketoade dilution, not Tucson summer dilution...

Plus, helena is higher altitude and just as dry. But feels much cooler. 

And, this week I dropped an unexplained 3 pounds below my normal weight in the morning though I am maintaining. That was this morning. I always fluctuate a few pounds say over day but seeing a new three pound LOW should have clued me in, but it didn't.

Welp, I got clued in fast. I was busy cleaning rooms today and I got really short of breath. Light headed. Pounding heart. The works. My hubby, The Bear, was most concerned... He practically had to carry me to the car. 

I haven't been in the ER for 2 and a half years, a record for me. In fact I haven't been sick. But other things are going on so I was kinda freaked out.

They got me in, my BP was lower than my normal 90 over 50. But my bloodwork and urine were fine. The doc hooked me up with saline and I sat around putting 2 and 2 together....

And yep, I managed to dehydrate myself lol. Despite everything, I who most definitely know better and swear by ketoade, screwed up.

Everyone, let this be my PSA: THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE ANY TIME. 

Make ketoade. Drink ketoade. And pay attention to the weather especially when you have moved somewhere new lol. The doc said they see a lot of it here in non keto people during summer and with heat snaps.",t3_o0qzn0

I hope that this information can get out quickly and spread widely because of the increase in alcohol use spurred by the pandemic.   Also we already know that a keto diet is great for treating fatty liver which is usually a symptom of heavy alcohol use.

48,"After a decade of agonising diarrhoea/ 'keto shits', I finally found the culprit.","I've been using keto on and off over the last decade to drop weight, originally after months of binge eating then eventually I'd use it to drop weight for sporting competitions. But I tried to stay low carb 60% of the time as a rule of thumb, but could never manage longer than that due to the debilitating and utterly miserable shits I would get on the diet.

For the last decade I dreaded going to the toilet because it was so damn painful. Eventually I got a hemorrhoid and the pain went up a whole level. So now instead of just being in agony on the toilet, I'd be in pain all damn day. Especially so when my job involves me working in hot conditions and getting sweaty. It wasn't pretty, let's just put it that way. I would often break the diet just for a reprieve from the pain of defecating.

Reading up on keto I heard many people talk of 'keto shits'. I just assumed I was one of the unfortunate few. No matter how much fibre I put into my diet, it would all come out like slush.

Anyway, I recently got back into strict full keto in an attempt to drop the obscene amount of weight I'd put on over lockdown and to start it was business as usual. Horrible shits, pain all day. Then I had a week where I couldn't get my go to snack, peanuts, and like Moses parting the brown sea, my diarrhoea went away!

I couldn't quite believe it. Peanuts. **Fucking peanuts**. For the last ten years I've been miserable and had an awful relationship with food and just got on with it as an unfortunate fact of life.

I am desperate and in seek of help/advice. I much appreciate anything, really.

I have always had high genetic cholesterol, my grandparents have it, my dad has it and are medicated with pills to reduce it. I decided to start keto in hopes of reducing my cholesterol and archieving a healthier version of myself. I was fed up with not taking care of myself in the pandemic and wanted to get my shit together.

Doctor just called me and I am scared to death. My last blood test, done 1 week ago, is NOT promissing at all. Numbers are even higher that what they used to be!

I have been told that I have to start medicating FOR LIFE (1 pill a day) to reduce my cholesterol and I just feel hopeless at this point. I try, I really do but nothing seems to work at this point.

For reference:

* Im a Female, 26 years old, 1,64cm and weight atm 67,75Kg (lost 5kg since February)
* My Keto diet consist of eating the less processed food as possible. I eat meat, fish, eggs, veggies, nuts and cheese.
* I do intense work out 2 times a week and try to stay active during the weekend.

carbs 20g

fat 90g

So I currently weigh 187 after about a week and a half on these macros, but my weight seems to fluctuate like crazy. yesterday I was 193 again, and today it went back down to 187 why is that? Exactly how many grams of carbs will knock me out of ketosis? I've read anything from 20-50 from all sorts of different sources. I really don't want to give up my 2-3 drinks per day, could alcohol be the culprit? I know some of these questions have probably been answered before but I was hoping for more specific feedback on my situation. I want to lose 30lbs as soon as humanly possible, do these macros look correct in order to do that with little to no exercise?

I've been having problems day 1 with OMAD and with keto past my first week though, mostly with hitting my protein macros and my electrolytes. I did the one meal plan on my first week so I assumed the protein macro hit but I couldn't stand the meals so I was trying out different keto recipes and from my food apps like chronometer and myfitnesspal they don't seem to violate the carb limit (I pretty much make only the top 5 recipes on the picture). My recipes go nowhere close to what the calculator demands and I could barely finish the meals in the first place. I still seem to be losing weight, maybe 1-2 pounds a week but I'm concerned with my health. I cannot hit my electrolytes particularly sodium I think. I drink a bottle of water with 2 (1/4 tsps) of lite salt per day which is a joke with the FAQ demanding 5000 as opposed to my 580-1000 from food and drink per day. How screwed am I?

I've been eating a lot of hard boiled eggs, bacon, and cheese. And I've tried a few keto recipes on carb manager that (I'm going to be totally honest) I wasn't a fan of at all.

I just don't see how I'm going to be able to do this for 6 more weeks. I'm always so tired, and I think about food almost all day every day. I've never been so obsessed with food before in my life so I'm having a hard time adjusting to always being hungry. It takes 0 effort for me to meet me 20 carbs a day, so when that happens I usually don't eat for the rest of the day.

I'm scared of trying ""keto approved snacks"" because I'm worried I'll gain weight even if I stay under 20carbs. I was a lover of pasta and sweet things, so no longer having carbs or sugars weird.

I felt so good I joined a gym and began working out 3 days a week and bike riding the other two days during the week.
The point is thst I had never been more motivated and dedicated to my health. Then boom! Freaking covid hit. My gym closed, it became to cold to ride. I became lazy and here I am today back where I started and even worse. I probably weigh 350. I did return to Keto on Jan. 1. I was down 20 in a month but got stuck there so I lost interest and hope. I now have no motivation to start again. I'm frustrated that I really have to work so hard physically to just maintain. I know nothing is easy but I mean hard. I am disabled with 2 previous back surgeries, a shoulder and a knee replacement, the other shoulder and knee need replaced. I have arthritis in virtually every joint. So working out physically does come with great pain. The cause of all my physical problems is thought to be the years of service in the 82nd airborne division and jumping and the physical requirements of being an infantryman.

71,"People who are deep in ketosis, do you still crave sugar?","I have been told that running on ketones for fuel, your blood sugar and insulin levels will reach a balanced, therefore natural values in the long run, allowing you to step out of the ""rollercoaster"" of low and high blood sugar, wich is said to be the cause of our sweet cravings.
This is the main reason I'm doing efforts to transition into keto. I'm saying transitioning because i tried cutting off carbs, or going ""cold turkey"" and I have come to the conclusion that i would rather not deal with the side effects, and take the baby steps path, by fasting (16/8) and eating only veggies and oat as my carbs for now, untill eventually cutting the oats too. I used to consume a fair amount of sugar in a day so even this is quite of a challenge.
It has been almost a week and I'm noticing that seeing candies and other carbs in the grocery store doesn't trigger the same urgent need to consume them, as it once used to do. Altough I must admit, I still sometimes fancy myself diving into a nice bowl of pasta or some sort of cake/pie.

72,I Haven't Had The Desire To Have Sex Since Starting Keto Nor Can I Sleep. What Am I Doing Wrong and When Will This Go Away?,"I've lost 16 pounds in a week and a half so far so I guess i'm getting the hang of this but I haven't thought about masturbating once since I started Keto and just realized that tonight. I also can't sleep. I lay in the bed for hours but am not going to sleep. 

The first week of keto, I had issues with my bowel movements. I had diarrhea and first then changed up my diet a bit (eating a bit less fat and increasing my veggies) and the diarrhea stopped but then I couldn't produce a bowel movement at all for almost 5 days. I took some magnesium citrate and ate lots of spinach and that got me back into gear. 

I miss masturbating so much. This is the longest i've even gone without it. 

**Is this normal for the keto diet? Why does this happen if it's a result of keto? What should I change or what am I doing wrong?**

**I'm eating 1200 calories or a bit less every day** and that keeps me full. I measure and weigh and count everything I eat. I have a food scale and write down everything I eat and count everything up. 

I eat a variety of things:

Ground turkey, Beef, Peppers, Onions, Avacado, Guac, Tomatoes, Salsa, Carb Smart Tortillas, Mushrooms, Cheese, Omlettes, black coffee, keto brownies (when I can fit them in but not everyday), boneless skinless chicken thighs, nutts, peanut butter, cod, tuna, salmon, spinach, broccoli, carrots, olive oil, butter, sour cream, etc.

**I eat no more than 25 carbs a day.**

I haven't yet gotten keto sticks to confirm whether or not i'm in ketosis. 

**I'm also doing OMAD/KETO.** And this is working well for me so far. As long as I eat enough fat, I'm good for the next day and don't get hungry. I fast for 24 hours. I eat from 3P.M. to 5P.M. each day. 

I'm a woman and I have a high BMI (over 40) at the moment. I'm targeting fat loss and am trying to get back to my former 145 pound self. I need this to work long term so I don't have to resort to weight loss surgery so I am wanting this journey to be a success.

75,Updates &amp; NSV,"October 2019, I shared that I had started my keto &amp; IF (16:8 intermittent fasting) journey thanks to all of the inspiration from you amazing redditors here. I was at my heaviest I‚Äôd ever been then, weighing in over 265 lbs and very depressed and grieving the loss of my mother. 

The first few months went amazingly well. The fat melted off of me: approximately 40 pounds in 4 months. XXL shirts felt like circus tents on me, and I could start wearing XL again; I could start wearing regular belts again; and most importantly, I was able to manage my grief &amp; depression better.

Then COVID happened. I was laid off from my job, unemployed, and feeling sorry for myself. I‚Äôm eternally grateful for my wonderful wife who has always been so supportive and encouraging. While I wasn‚Äôt following a keto diet anymore, I held onto the lessons I had learned and maintained my weight. 

I eventually found another job, not the most glamorous as custodial, but I was grateful for being able to work again, and I was very active with this position, walking close to 11 miles a day while pushing heavy carts full of trash, which helped me lose another 10 pounds almost immediately. I was able to secure a more stable position working from home. I was starting to go back into my old habits of indulging in sugary comfort foods and gained those 10 pounds back in about 6 months, but I didn‚Äôt let it dishearten me.

Last month, I went back to working with the public in a retail job and decided to get back into the keto saddle and work hard at maintaining it, maybe with a cheat day or two because I genuinely enjoy food. I‚Äôve been loosely following the weekly meal prep I found here (a couple of changes here &amp; there based on what I‚Äôve learned I enjoy) and have found that with a more keto-focused diet (I‚Äôm not following macros or counting calories), I haven‚Äôt been as hungry anymore!

I‚Äôm back to steadily losing weight, feeling better about myself, and the best part about it is that I have gone down a size in my shirts &amp; pants for my work uniforms! 

Thank you for inspiring me every day, and I hope this story helps to inspire others as well.",t3_o0gkur
76,Plateau?,"28M 6‚Äô7‚Äù SW 468 CW418 GW275  


Hey all, been on keto now for a little over 2 months. Im down 50lbs and feel great, however I'm only down about 1-2 lbs the past 2 weeks. Its been a bit discouraging. I understand there's a bit of a ""honeymoon"" period where you lose a ton and then plateau a bit, but how can I maintain a more steady weight loss?  


*\*\*(A few facts about my daily intake, i do include Zero/Diet beverages occasionally as well as zero net carb tortillas/breads about once a week as a ""treat"".)*",t3_o0vsfd
77,I don‚Äôt have a clue what I‚Äôm supposed to eat.,"I suspect I have a problem with blood sugar levels, I have been to the doctor once for a blood test but was told everything was fine.

I have mood and energy swings quite often, with the bad days taking all the motivation away from me‚Ä¶I‚Äôll scrape by on the bare minimum required in the day.

Just recently I have quit alcohol and cut down on sugar, the first because I can not handle hangovers anymore‚Ä¶and I even notice a change in mood if I have a couple of drinks and then stop drinking‚Ä¶strange but true, if I start then I‚Äôm better off carrying on until I‚Äôm home and going to bed!

With the sugar I actually feel quite happy most the time when I eat a fair bit of sugar in the day, it keeps me going nicely but I know it‚Äôs not the greatest way to get by due to the overeating that follows it and the mental confusion it seems to inflict.

So I have started eating ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù but my god it‚Äôs like the micro biome in my gut are being tortured without sugar (I‚Äôve learnt a bit about the gut but am no expert, I am just trying to explain how it feels). I get this really hungry feeling and at the same time get this temporary depressive feeling in my head where the brakes are pressed down fully to the point that even though I‚Äôm starving I can‚Äôt be bothered to get up and go and make some food! Crazy I know, and this is no matter how much I eat‚Ä¶I can eat loads and still feel starving.

So by healthy this is generally what I would eat:- (I have a busy physical job, exercise a bit and am 34, M, 5‚Äô7‚Äù)


Breakfast:- 3 whole meal toast with butter, 6 eggs, 4 rashers of bacon (roughly 1250 calories)

Or 

100g oats, 300ml whole milk, with some berries mixed in (roughly 700 calories)


Lunch:- some kind of salad that my lady makes for me that has chicken, beef or salmon, some kind of whole grain (brown rice, buckwheat, quinoa etc), bell peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, some sort of cheese, and a dressing of some kind. (Roughly 1000 calories)

Overnight oats in the afternoon.


Dinner:- at the moment we are eating these frozen meals sent from a company called ‚Äúall plants‚Äù from a company in the uk. This helps with getting a bit of time back in the evenings without having to worry about cooking or cleaning up. They will have all sorts of plant based ingredients (roughly 500 calories)


So eating like this and cutting out all sugar has left me up and down on a day to day basis I really can‚Äôt think what it is that I‚Äôm doing so badly.

I always thought that a fair bit of fat in the morning is a good way to start and a smaller meal in the evening is better so that it can be digested before I start sleeping.

The only time I can really say with confidence that I have felt good in the past was when I cracked keto for the first time (since then I‚Äôve tried it a few times but not had the same success). I think that now that I‚Äôm not drinking it may be worth trying it again‚Ä¶ I remember not eating for 24 hours and hitting the gym and feeling like terminator on the treadmill. So much energy and it felt great!

I wanted to stay away from the idea of keto because I hate the social aspect of it‚Ä¶where I‚Äôm from it‚Äôs not popular üòÇ. But if I‚Äôm not drinking, and staying away from sugar‚Ä¶even if I‚Äôm not on keto I‚Äôm a social recluse anyway! 

One thing that annoyed me about keto was trying to get the right balance of electrolytes, because when I would say it‚Äôs just not clicking the advice I would get was sort out your electrolytes! But maybe the alcohol I was drinking had more of a say in it than I thought at the time.

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had felt the same in any way? Because I‚Äôm really starting to get pissed off lol.

TLDR - quitting sugar has left me going crazy, not sure if the healthy food I‚Äôm eating is healthy, and should I go back to keto.",t3_o0vavk

81,2.5months lost 3fricken pounds.,"Jeez, depressing to write. To start off I was an extreme exersizer in my 20s. I ran 12 miles daily, never dieted. Then after two babies, and a pregnancy that kept me on bed rest for 5 months‚Ä¶ I got heavy. About 2.5 years ago I lost 60lbs on keto. Then my life took a stressful turn when both my children ended up in the hospital. I lost my mind a bit. One of my children ended up being diagnosed with some delays, and the other had respiratory issues. I was on constant alert. I quit sleeping. I ended up on psych meds and then terrible anxiety attacks. I weaned myself off the meds and started running about 3 very slow miles a day. I also used CBD in leu of benzos to sleep. Fast forward 1.5 years and I gained 35lbs. I ate about 1800 calories a day low carb but not keto. I went in for a doctors appointment and was alerted to my weight. So, since then I have been strict keto and surprise! lost 3 pounds. The weight fell off before, but this time it isn‚Äôt. I weigh 194lbs. I eat about 1400calories -carbs around 20 give or take 5carbs. Fat is 90-95g. and protein 95-100g. And I am constantly hungry- something that I didn‚Äôt experience the first time in ketosis.

The pain is pretty mild. Has anyone else had this early on and then it went away? I really really don‚Äôt want to have to have my gallbladder removed!

85,5+ week stall. Tips for getting past this plateau?,"Hi everyone, I've been doing keto for 4 months and have lost 28lbs.... But that was over 5 weeks ago. Since then, nothing. The scales haven't moved an inch, and neither has the tape measure. 

I'm still in ketosis (based on rash, breath and sweat smell, and overall feeling of being satiated), and have no issue sticking to the diet. 

I'm good at following the FAQ, so I know what the usual pitfalls are for ending up on a plateau. But I don't think any of them apply to me; I stick to my macros and adjust them as I lose weight, and I know exactly what I eat by counting calories and weighing my food. 

Stats: Female, Age 25, 5ft 8, 177lbs.

Macros: 1054 cal, 95g protein, 25g total carbs, 64g fat. 

Daily intermittent fasting routine: 16/8, but this is definitely gravitating towards OMAD due to hunger subsidence. 

Electrolytes are mainly supplemented through Lo Salt (""50/50 salt"") - I've never had keto flu or headaches, so always feel like I'm getting enough of what I need. And I drink plenty of fluids in a day. 

I still feel energised and clear headed as I did when first starting the diet, even though I've been consistently on a a pretty low calorie deficit. I don't feel hungry either, so would struggle to start eating more. 

I'm not super active: I work from home so am sat down all day, with going up and down the stairs to the toilet being my only exercise really, other than that I only do 2.5 hours of pole dance and trapeze a week at my local studio. Definitely no daily gym visits, so I'm not really expecting water retention due to muscle tears. 

...is it possible that with my level of inactivity, my estimated BMR is still too high for me? All the posts I've read would definitely dissuade me from cutting down even more, but I have to say that I would have expected to feel a hell of a lot rougher on such a deficit.

94,Desk job and stress killing all gains? 2 part post. Also does anyone face memory issues that were solved by keto.,"So basically i graduated and started interning at a consulting firm. Hours were decently long (9 am to 7 pm). I was exercising a lot back then (1 hour at the gym and 1 hour walk at night). Faced a lot of stress and pressure and long hours sitting on the desk couples with 4-5 cigarettes a day. However I was eating very healthy. Boiled eggs for lunch and chicken breast with veggies at night. Unfortunately I didn't see many gains and kept losing weight but still no muscle definition or any elevation in mood levels. I did reach my target weight though but that was a process that had been happening since I had been exercising.

Fast forward 4 months and after the end of my internship I move back home and there is a lockdown in my country. I start binging a lot and let my diet go for a toss. I don't have much stress and most of the work I do for my master's gets over in 4-5 hours a day. I keep up my exercise regimen though and start seeing great results despite eating a lot of carbs and fats (biscuits, cakes, all kinds of fruits, gnocchi, pasta). For the first time I see abs and good muscle definition. 

However, since the last week, I joined work again and have been taking a lot of stress. However I haven't quit exercising and I'm eating healthier. Unfortunately I feel discomfort around my belly and chest and I know it may sound impossible but in a week I have seen my body change and bloat up. Even my face looks fatter. I am exercising a lot too. Idk if it's due to stress or the long hours at the desk?

Secondly I have this thing since childhood in which I have cycles during which I can retain things quickly however there are times when even the basic things won't make sense. Even if I try to remember the most basic words that I have read it will take me 10 revisions to do so. I am guessing that this is connected to my diet.

Tonight: my pain decreased all day and for an experiment I had ice cream.  Boom, pain and swelling right back. My wife says she can see it in my hands.  Low carb/keto is a lifesaver.

Today, Tuesday June 15th, I am LC all day every day.  I really love this group.  You have all been very helpful!! I'll check in later.",t3_nzmvld
98,Not hungry? Fat adapted?,"For context, I am 26F/4‚Äô11‚Äù SW 147 CW 131 GW 110. 

I‚Äôve been doing Keto since the beginning of May (I was doing CICO before) and have lost about 1.5 lb per week on average, which I think is a fairly safe rate of weight loss. But recently I just haven‚Äôt really been able to hit my macros, because I haven‚Äôt been hungry! I‚Äôm eating only about 900-1000 calories (my target is 1175) which is maybe normal for someone my size, but I‚Äôm still slightly concerned I may not be eating enough. It‚Äôs hard to find info out there that‚Äôs accurate for petites like myself. 

I am wondering whether I may be fat adapted even though I sometimes go way over my net carbs target of 15g. Is it possible I‚Äôm in ketosis even when eating about 25-30g of net carbs a day?",t3_o0ad5p
99,"Canned corn with 1.5g of carbs, is that even possible?","Hey, I've been doing keto for a few weeks now and I find the variability in the carb count in the same product for different brands super confusing,  for example, I ecently bought almond butter that counts 18g of carbs. Then saw another one In the store that says 4.6g - just from another brand, both with the only ingredient 100% almonds. 

The same with peanut butter, 100 peanuts - one says 22g per 100g and another says 3.4g per 100g 

I even saw canned corn that marked ""light"" with only 1.5g of carbs. And normal corn is 40g+

102,Keto and food aversion.,I‚Äôm on my 3rd attempt at sticking with keto for longer than a year. I‚Äôm going on 6 weeks at the moment and I‚Äôm having an issue with food aversion.

103,"One month celebration, feeling strong and no more hypoglycemia!","Today is officially one month since I've started keto, and I'm feeling really great about my results so far.

One month ago today I weighed 202 pounds at 173 centimeters, having gone up and down over the course of years and struggling to maintain a healthy weight. I also regularly suffered from the effects of hypoglycemia, without really even knowing what hypoglycemia was. I spoke to my doctor and found out that this could be a sign that I'm prediabetic, so as you can imagine I started to become more concerned about my health. 

I did regular calorie counting for a couple of months, with some success getting down to about 199 pounds from 210 pounds at my highest, but the hunger and the cravings were too hard for me to ignore and I ended up slipping up and going back up to 202 pounds.

 I knew that keto would work from past experience, but I dragged my feet on it for a while because I didn't want to deal with the lack of energy the first few weeks. Eventually though, I realized that what I was doing wasn't going to work, and that the only thing that would reliably keep my appetite in check enough to lose weight consistently was keto.

I am now down to 188.6 pounds today, over twenty pounds lighter than I was half a year ago, and 14 pounds lighter than a month ago. I'm now considered overweight rather than obese, and I haven't had a single instance of hypoglycemia. My energy is consistent throughout the day now, and I'm excited to keep making progress.

I know this isn't nearly as impressive as some of the people on here that have lost crazy amounts of weight and turned their lives around, but I wanted to share my success with everyone here because this place has really kept me motivated and engaged enough to keep pushing through, and I owe my success at least partly to all of the people here that have educated me with their advice and inspired me with their stories. 

I've still got a long way to go before I reach a healthy weight, but I'm confident now that I can do it and stay healthy! So thank you all for your advice, your stories, and your support throughout this last month, because I don't know if I could have done this well without it!",t3_nzv9s4
104,Keto Rash... Is there more obvious evidence of what I can do to prevent it?,"My wife and I do a 500 calorie no-carb like diet and every time I do it, I end up developing a keto rash after the first week. I've done this diet twice with super successful results but have to deal with a terrible rash on my stomach and back. Every time I look up solutions to what causes it or how to help prevent it, I find ""maybes"" and uncertainty. 

Anyone know of the reason for the cause and how to prevent it? I'm currently 9 days into the diet and already showing itchy bumps on my chest. I recently read somewhere that it is likely caused by my body going into ketosis and because I haven't consumed carbs, it causes the rash. Last night I started adding a quarter cup of beans to my dinner in hopes that it stops, but still unsure as it's only been a day.",t3_o0gora

Weight went down by 10 lbs in one week, but since then no change in weight and it's been a couple weeks.  Not feeling hungry but still something is putting the kibosh to calorie burning.  Could it be starvation mode, and if it is, how do I make it stop?  Do I eat more calories, less, or just wait it out and let my body just get used to the idea?",t3_o0rv8m
106,keto diet stopped working?,"Hi, I was able to completely fix my acid reflux disease and discontinue omeprazole thru the keto diet, but about a year ago it stopped working. Was wondering if anyone had any ideas.

‚Ä¢¬†2009 develop acid reflux after night of heavy drinking. Prescribed high dose of omeprazole, become pretty reliant on it.

‚Ä¢¬†2018 start keto diet. Starts off pretty rough but once I figure out I need to eat a shit ton of salt it evens out, and cures my acid reflux. 

‚Ä¢¬†2019 is one of the best/most productive years of my life - energy levels are through the roof due to keto - start running, meditating daily, doing long term projects etc. 

‚Ä¢¬†June 2020 I change up my electrolyte routine. Originally I was doing 400mg of magnesium glycinate plus an electrolyte mix with 150 mg magnesium oxide, and salting my water - i eliminate the magnesium glycinate and stop salting my water almost completely.

‚Ä¢¬†September 2020 I stop taking any sort of magnesium supplementation at all.

‚Ä¢¬†Start to feel really shitty on runs, and fatigued in general. I try a bunch of different things to fix it but don't think to go back to my old magnesium/salt routine until January 2021.

‚Ä¢¬†January 2021 I take a magnesium glycinate and I immediately feel way better. I realize that I've been having magnesium deficiency symptoms the past several months

‚Ä¢¬†I get so excited about magnesium glycinate that I take 4x400mg magnesium glycinate to cure a hangover. This is way too much and actually sort of extends my hangover. for a couple days. I go completely off magnesium and resume at a much lower dose (100 mg)

‚Ä¢¬†The lower dose turns out to be too low. I keep experimenting and can't seem to get a stable dose. 100mg seems too low and 400mg seems to high - keep feeling shitty because my electrolytes are off.

‚Ä¢¬†March 2021 My ability to tolerate keto diet/digest fat completely deteriorates. I can't seem to possibly eat enough keto-calories. Start experiencing super early satiety when eating fully keto. Will substantially undereat for 3 days straight, then absolutely binge eat on keto-ish stuff, like wings or chicken nuggets. 

Fatigue back. Can't run more than 2 miles without feeling awful. It seems more or less like I've worked out how to manage magnesium, but my stomach is still fucked up.

‚Ä¢¬†June 2021 go to gastroenterologist, he gives me upper endoscopy, so far I have gotten the results from the camera - stomach looks good, no ulcer, no polyps, if I had no symptoms he'd say its a perfect stomach - still waiting on the results from the biopsies/enzyme production tests h pylori etc

&amp;#x200B;

For the record I'm a tall skinny male, Didn't do keto to lose weight. I've tried probiotics, hydrochloric acid, ox bile, to help with keto digestion - nothing seems to be the fix. Anybody with similar experiences? Pretty much at a loss as to what is going on here.

I went by myself today and picked up a few groceries. As usual, I grabbed 3 or 4 pints of Enlightened ice cream. When I got home, my wife started putting up the groceries. She had a small heart attack when she the words ‚Äú8g net carbs‚Äù on the containers, although the rest of the packaging was identical. The previous packaging read ‚Äú1g net carbs‚Äù. 

Actually, the company has started putting 8 g net carbs PER PINT on the package instead of 1 g net carbs PER SERVING. Everything is still the same as far as ingredients. So, read and don‚Äôt freak out if you see the different package.",t3_nzt2fw

118,Not sure this is working for me..?,"I have started keto over 2 weeks ago. I have done it before back in 2012.

My starting weight was 155lbs (5'8) and I initially in the first days I have lost 4-5lbs, but since then - nothing. My weight goes up and down a bit, but basically stays around 150lbs. I'm staying well below 20g of carbs a day and in calorie deficit. My macros are decent as well, maybe sometimes too much protein in place of fat. I drink probably at least 2 litres of water and I supplement electrolytes, but I don't think I am getting enough of them.  


Apart from not really moving much further with the weight, I have also noticed my resting heart rate has gone up by 10bpm - at the start of the night is around 68bpm then after an hour it suddenly goes to 74-78bmp and stays there the whole night (whilst sleeping).  


I guess I am looking for a bit of troubleshooting - could it be not enough water, or the electrolytes, or maybe I'm just being impatient...?

122,My unlucky story of getting back into Keto after many great successes before!,"Let me preface this story by stating that I am an avid proponent for Keto, long time lurker here, lost a good 70-80 lbs about 6 years ago with Keto, kept it off for a good 2 years until I started cheating and eventually gained the weight back up and even more. I incorporated calorie counting, carb loading for optimal weight/workout routines. I was into it 1000% This is a long story, i appreciate you reading it through, i will write TLDR at the end.

Now as of right now, I'm currently on 4 different drugs right now, NORCO for the pain, Naproxen for the anti-inflammatory, Ondansetron ODT for anti-nausea, and Augmentin for the antibiotics because of an unlucky set of circumstances. Let me tell how it all began.  
If you lurk into my post history, it's pretty sparse, but the most significant latest one was about a month ago, where i rolled my ankle at a disc golf tournament and the damage looks pretty gnarly (Looks so much better now). What happened immediately though was my normal hygiene routine went out the window as i was bedridden for 2 weeks. i only made my trips to the bathroom when it was absolutely necessary as the pain was too great and the desire to be in a safe horizontal position. What used to be a normal 2 time a day brush/floss/mouthwash routine went out the window, which caused an opportunity for some unsavory bacteria to build up in areas around my mouth.

Time went on, my foot start getting better to where i was able to walk on it better, day by day. my oral hygiene started to resume, but not to 100%. No noticeable signs of anything different. Last weekend i committed to getting back into losing weight, as i knew my weight had a part to play in my injury, the fact that i'm over 90 lbs where i should be at, that i have a wonderful 7 month year old i want to spend a healthy life with for as much as i can, i know what i needed to do for myself (31 years :) )   


I got prepped my meals, i had my ketoade ready and i started off day 1 by cutting the carbs off ( i've always done cold turkey every Keto session with great success, i figured it would be the same, but i believe if i chose a weaning out method, i could have prevented this). End of day 1, i started to feel the fatigue effects of the Keto Flu, mainly Sodium related but good on the Potassium and Magnesium end.   


I then started to feel a pain on the left side of my mouth, in which i incorrectly diagnosed the root cause of as canker sores. i've dealt with them before but they can give pretty bad pain, i quickly dismissed it to my downfall. throughout the week i started getting chills and hot flashes (i didn't want to call it a fever because that's not how i thought it was initially), certain Thyroids during keto flu induction causes temperature regulations to go a little haywire so i believed the chills and hot flashes to be a result of that. I was still having fatigue issues and not having enough sodium so i started cranking it up even more. by Day 3. the Chills and what now i assumed to be a fever, ramped up, a sore throat suddenly developed, it became difficult to eat or drink or sleep, and i developed a short inconsistent dry cough. I was like ""what are the chances of me starting Keto, i got the coronavirus?"" (I had been vaccinated through Pfizers for both doses). Long story short, i got the rapid and normal test done and both were negative. Day 5 rolls around, now my gums are swelling from center to left side only, my left lymph node felt swollen, and my throat hurts really bad. I knew something was off and i had to stop Keto to remove any more Keto flu symptoms to get a better handle.

Well i ended up having to go to the E.R. as the pain was so immense, i couldn't drink water or even have thin soups, they gave me the above medication to take (no longer feeling pain thanks to that norco). But after trying to understand WHY did this all happen and speaking with the doctor. We both came to the same conclusion.

My ankle injury and my routine oral hygiene schedule being disrupted caused some unsavory bacteria to hang around my Parotid gland area. When i did Keto, your body goes through a state of dumping water, and from what your gland sees, a time of dehydration. The gland became exposed because of the dehydration, and the bacteria was able to get inside and infect the gland, caused all the chills and fevers what were assumed to be the symptoms of keto flu, generated all the pain in the mouth and throat and swelling of the gums which was initially thought it was because of canker sores. I'm not sure if i managed the sodium intake better, if it could have prevented this from happening. i dont know.

TALK ABOUT THE WORST LUCK EVER. but guys, im not done yet, when this is over, going back into it again. Keto works, and i appreciate the advice that's given here and what the community has done for it's members. just wanted to give a terribly unlucky story.

TLDR: Got a foot injury a month ago, oral hygiene care was disrupted, caused bacteria to permeate a gland area, i restarted keto, dehydration caused the bacteria to infect the gland, i thought initially the pain came from canker sores, the chills and hot flashes came from keto flu symptoms, then the symptoms got worse, went to doc, got tested negative for covid, they checked my gland, saw it was f-ed up, gave me Antibiotics, had to go to E.R. because pain intensified to a 10, now riding (or writing?) high as a kite.

125,My Keto roll game fully evolved today,"Edit I was asked for a picture of the inside of the bin

https://imgur.com/a/XH8ivI4

So my world changed once I discovered the keto king bread recipe (which I've tweaked slightly) and I was so grateful to be able to use my bread machine that I bought in the early stages of the pandemic (pre keto for me)

But recently I've taken to making rolls/buns/whatever you call them....and today I think I reached peak form!

Dry ingredients

190g vital wheat gluten

51g oat fibre

60g Lupin flour

1 tsp salt

1 tbsp allulose

1 tbsp dry yeast

2.5 tbsp inulin

1/2  tsp xanthan gum

Wet ingredients

240ml warm water (120¬∞f - 130¬∞f)

2 eggs lightly beaten

30g ghee

Equipment

Ideally a stand mixer with a dough hook

Instructions

1) Put the water, yeast and inulin into a bowl (I do it directly in the mixer bowl and let it bloom for about 10 mins until it's nice and foamy

2) Add the beaten eggs and the ghee

3) Add the dry ingredients and then roughly combine with the dough hook

4) Knead on medium high for like 10-12 mins until the gluten has built up, the dough is in a good ball and springs back when you press a finger in it

5) Make into 60g balls (this made a dozen rolls) or smaller if you want more....totally up to you

6) Place on parchment lined baking trays leaving a couple of inches between each dough ball and loosely cover in cling wrap/seran wrap/whatever you call it

7) Prove in the oven, or somewhere warm (I tend to put a roasting tray with a kettles worth of hot water in it at the bottom of the oven to create the warm steamy environment that the rolls love)...leave for 45 mins

8) Remove rolls from the oven and remove the water tray, then heat the oven to 350¬∞f.

9) Once up to temperature, remove the cling/seran wrap and bake the rolls for 20 - 25 mins

10) Remove them from the oven and resist the temptation to not eat them all as they smell like fresh bread.

Normally a batch will last a full week in an airtight container, and freeze well too!

I know that you can totally buy keto bread etc, but nothing beats making stuff yourself!

131,How effective has keto been for you in eliminating pre-diabetes?,"I‚Äôd love to hear anecdotes about those who were able to reduce/eliminate pre-diabetes via keto. My father was recently diagnosed with Type II and when we tested everyone‚Äôs blood sugar for fun, mine was definitely high. I haven‚Äôt been formally diagnosed with anything but previous markers and random other symptoms have indicated pre-diabetes and I‚Äôm ready to make a change. 

I‚Äôve struggled with binge eating in the past and also have ADHD (which go hand in hand), so impulsivity can be an issue for me, particularly as meds wear off and I look to sugar for that quick dopamine response. As a result, I tend to go all in with diets but fall off quickly. That said, considering my situation and family history, I want to do what makes the most sense in terms of diet - specifically, what type of eating will help me achieve both weight loss and staving off pre-diabetes/diabetes. 

Any stories, advice, or anything you all might have to offer would be awesome. I‚Äôm ready, I just need to get my scrambled brain on board!",t3_nzt3fl

Since then I haven‚Äôt lost anything which I‚Äôm not too concerned about, but being new to Keto it makes me question a couple things.

I do HIIT training 4x a week and strength 2x a week, for at least an hour minimum. Does this sound right? Should I be aiming for something less/different?

137,Learnings and tips after 6 weeks of keto,"I've just rounded off 6 weeks of keto and lost 1.5 inches from my waist without calorie counting/while still drinking alcohol. I thought I'd share some stuff that I would have liked to know in week 1-2.

* Mashed swede in bubble and squeak is really similar to potato, I might actually do this sub even when I'm eating carbs again.
* If you roast radishes in the oven with a tonne of butter, salt, and parmesan, they're a lot like roasted baby potatoes.
* Cauliflower roasted with olive oil, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, then dipped in mayo is great.
* Nandos is the best keto takeaway by a mile and doesn't feel like a compromise.
* Yes cucumber has a surprising amount of carbs.
* You get drunk way faster on keto, and a bad hangover is so much worse. 
* I found it really hard to get my calories up without carbs and had a few 1000 calorie days where I just didn't want to eat, which I don't think is useful or healthy so nuts and cottage cheese are good for just grazing if that's the case.
* Fake bread or brownies just made me want the real thing more so it might be better to distract yourself rather than looking for keto alternatives. 
* Beyond keto flu, I was pretty low energy throughout. 
* Despite loving simple carbs like potato and bread, I actually missed big piles of veg more so it was definitely worth storing up carbs for veggies every so often.
* Bare naked spaghetti is way more like noodles than spaghetti but with tonnes of cheese and meat, you can make them work.",t3_nzsk6e
138,Keto Peanut Butter Pie - LF: input on specific recipe (link &amp; macros in post),"Hi r/keto folks, 

I'm relatively new to keto-life (3 months) and looking for some help with a specific dessert recipe I found online. I've included the custom macros at the bottom of the post.

I found this recipe for [Keto Peanut Butter Pie](https://explorermomma.com/keto-peanut-butter-pie/) online through a google, I did make the recipe and it yields a huge pie. The recipe calls for a lot of almond flour, swerve, and peanut butter.

I put the custom recipe into Carb Manager and it is coming up as **""Keto Grade Avoid.""** I suspect this is due to the really high total carb count which is 26 grams of carbs per serving. Carb Manager is telling me **the net carbs per serving are 7.3 grams**. 

I was hoping that some of the r/keto pros could give me their opinion on this recipe. **Is this recipe actually  ""Avoid""  or are there are any modifications I could do to make it a little more keto-friendly?** I tried playing with the ingredients in the custom recipe to see if changes such as less almond flour, less swerve, less PB, etc., would give it a better keto-grade but I didn't have much luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

The macros (in Carb Manager) for one serving of my custom recipe using my ingredients are as follows: 

Calories: 512

**Total Carbs:** 26.2g

* Net Carbs: 7.3g
* Fiber: 4.5g
* Starch: 0g
* Sugar: 2.7g
* added sugar: 0g
* Sugar Alcohols: 14.4g

**Protein:** 11.7g

**Fat:** 47.8g

139,NSV finally made pizza,"I‚Äôve been making OK keto pizza but they alway felt a little off. It just wouldn‚Äôt taste right and the crust was too floppy.

Pizza is one of those grail foods to me and I was beginning to wonder if I need to budget some carbs for a pizza per year or something. 

But finally today after many pizzas it all came together. I finally made a pizza that would have fooled most people and tasted great.

My problem was I was trying to make Italian pizza and my success came when I switched to making American pizza. 

There is simply no way you can make Italian style thin chewy crusts keto friendly, or at least I‚Äôve failed to. With the goal of thin crust this also means minimal toppings as the crust isn‚Äôt mechanically sound enough for anything heavy. 

But with American style, everything is different. You have a thick sturdy crust and also lots of toppings. 

I made a sturdy crust by using the canned chicken method but made sure to dry it out enough before using and to give extra blind bake time to really get it crisp. And since this was an American style pizza I piled on the toppings. I more than doubled the cheese. I hit the toppings with 500¬∞F but then brought it down to 325¬∞F for a longer bake to melt the cheese. 

The pizza came out thicc. The cheese was stringy. The crust held straight like a ruler. It tasted like Domino‚Äôs. Normally that would be an insult but not in my books. This was a huge win for keto sustainability. 

I‚Äôll write down my process next time and take pictures.",t3_nzetuq

144,SOS - Really Bad Crampa,"Hi.  Yes, I've read the FAQ -several times.  I still need asistance.

Cramps.  Really bad leg cramps, every night, for weeks.  I am only averaging about 4 hours of sleep a night because of them.  Please help me out?

FACTS 

I'm using chronometer. 
I record everything I eat, drink, and exercise.
I am averaging about 64 oz of water a day.
56f, lost 30 lbs so far, started keto mid march.
I take plant based (Innate Response) vitamins, including Magnesium-300, per day.
Per Chronometer for aggressive weight loss:
   740 cal, 50 protein, 20 carbs, 51 fat.
I always make my protein, never go above carbs or cal or fat.  Ok, I've gone over maybe twice by accident.
I eat 2 meals a day, IF for 16 hours between dinner and lunch, religiously. 
I make my own ketoade - I take fresh ginger and make a very strong tisane, then use about a quarter cup of that mixed with 63.5 oz filtered water and a tsp fresh lemon juice, then add potassium via NoSalt.

I'm always over on magnesium and sodium, averaging about 140% for both - 303mg and 1950mg, respectively.
At first, I didnt get cramps for the first two months, then they came with a vengence.

WHAT I'VE TRIED 

Initially my potassium was low so I started making ketoade per above.  Some days I would only get 32 or less ketoade but that's unusual.  I get plenty of sodium just by the food I eat and the sea salt I use for spicing food.  When I exercise, I drink more water 

Thinking the issue has to be potassium, I have gradually added more and more potassium to ketoade but no matter how much I drink in a day, the cramps never get better.  I sip on ketoade all day and evening.

I eat veg almost daily and have a varied meal plan, almost all homemade, from scratch.  I am religious about weighing meals and eating well.

Yesterday - just to see if I am one of those folks who need WAY more potassium than most I took in 7390 (284%) potassium as I am desperate for sleep.  After 3 hours of sleep the cramps kicked in horribly.  Here I am, at 330am writing...  :( :( :(

I have been tweaking macros as much as I can and I just dont know what to do anymore.  

Please help?  Please tell me what I'm missing??  It has to be something but no matter what I add more or less of, nothing seems to work.  

Thank you.

UPDATE:
I am very grateful for the help I've received today.

Even tho folks read the FAQs - even multiple times, theres a lot to take in to do keto safely.  I wish I were eidetic so I only had to read the FAQs once.  But...its a lot to take in.  FAQs, new foods, tracking apps, electrolytes, vitamins, all the while trying to just get thru a day.  Then maybe forgetting something critical, or just thinking something is correct when in fact, it isnt.  

Then theres trying to sift thru ALL in the info out there...often by convincing people with decent credentials...  starting is harder than it seems and people are prone to mistakes and maybe mixing up facts.

I'm glad the keto community is pretty forgiving in this way.  I've found a great deal of support and patience. 

So, thank you keto people.",t3_nzhb7i

149,"peanuts - why are they considered a ""meh"" keto snack?","Seems peanuts are in the middle of the quality gradient of most keto articles I've read.

There are about 4x the net carbs in peanuts.

Doing the math, even if you eat an absolutely monstrous amount of these, let's say 3,000 calories-worth (day's worth for an active person), you still wouldn't make it to 20 net carbs since one serving is 170 Calories with 1g of net carbs (4g carbs - 3g fiber = 1g sugar). 3,000 / 170 = 18 servings or 18 net carbs for a day's worth of the food.

150,Metabolism of alcohol. (The claim that always keeps coming back),"You often hear that ""in your body alcohol turns into sugar"" but I have never found any evidence for it, nor does it make sense biologically for body to take a simple a simple molecule and turn it into a complex one.

Yet again, only two weeks ago a biologist who I was talking with affirmed the same thing (but that doesn't mean much because if you're an expert in any domain you know how wrong an expert can be in the given domain).

To add to the conundrum, after going a little too far with enjoying the summer, I registered a 1.5kg jump after a weekend of moderately heavy drinking. (Not binge drinking but definitely more than ""healthy"") which in my case looks a lot like accidentally falling out of keto.

What's the verdict on alcohol? I do understand it's not good and slows progress but can it be as bad as revert the progress and stop keto altogether? Specifically I mean how does it play out in terms of metabolism?

I want to ask skinny people though. Cause I am skinny. I feel like in this forum a lot of people are trying to lose massive amounts of weight and that weight loss could possibly be associated with the increased energy rather than the particulars of the keto diet itself. It could be a confounding factor. Since I am skinny fat, (19 percent body fat) I just want to get input from people who are skinny who went on keto and their experiences of their energy level and how its changed them if it has.

Today, on June 12th, I weighed in at 197 on my scale. 

280 to 197 in about 9 months of lazy keto. I think that's pretty decent. KCKO

my macros are 32 carbs, 200(i average 204-230, but decided to cap 200g of fat), 100-120g of protein. i eat mostly red meat and cheese. a lot of pork and beef, full-fat brie-cheddar-cream cheeses. calories 2000-2700. i try to avoid nuts and seeds and stuff. i try to eat avocados for carbs.

i did not know what carbs were, at the time, so i did not really have macros. i just knew i needed a lot of calories to exercise then and knew i'd only be able to train as much as i could eating beef. i did like bread starch for my muscles, then.

right now, i get majority of calories at breakfast and lunch and an avocado is my dinner or so. i do try to fast on weekends. i have done 48-72 hour fasts water or dry fasts. i just started weight lifting agan. trying to do it every night instead of in the morning.

i average 2 - 2 3/4'th pounds of red meat a day.

i am moderately active, a caregiver, do'er of odd jobs when i can. don't plan to be an athlete, but want to workout arms, shoulders, chest, abs. i only really ride my bike and do wall sit exercises and calve raises. i do want to get my big knee muscles back, but that was years of sprinting to get that.

not really into drugs, drinking, junkfood. i don't have a 'vice', so i guess i had to get avocados or low carb candy bars. i want to try keto culture white bread.

so, i am the 3 meals a day type, pretty much.

i rotate between fresh meats, sausages. i try to find low carb stuff and portion it out. i eat these early in the day because that's the best time to eat anything with the simple sugars.

i seem to urinate the same amount of water i take in, so i guess my carbs are low enough that i'm not retaining too much water.

169,Gaining rather than losing: I can't help but think I am missing something.,"I've included all my details, goals, and macros at the bottom of this post for any amazing soul out there that might be kind enough to have a look to make sure I haven't misjudged some figure somewhere. One of the first things I anticipate you all saying is... *""Dude... you've been on Keto for 4 months, and you've lost 26 lbs. At your age and activity level... that's not bad at all. Just don't give up and it will work. It is working already.""* 

To be honest, that would be a valid response. But... some of my dates and numbers are a little fuzzy, in that I started Keto &gt; lost weight &gt; had some missteps &gt; gained weight &gt; started again... and in the beginning, I honestly was not weighing myself, measuring any of my macros, and I certainly wasn't calculating and weighing my food. So... really... my actual ""strict Keto"" adherence with macros, daily goals, and tracking/weighing my food is more like this.

**Started:** May 16  
**Weight**: 362.6 lbs  
**Current Weight:** 360.4 lbs  
**Time on Keto:** 29 days (4 weeks)  
**Weight lost:**  2.2 lbs  
**Rate:** 0.55 lbs/week

I use the food tracking app Cronometer for everything. (macros and goals below). I am incredibly frustrated, and to be honest... a little frightened that this amazing lifestyle that has done so much for so many... just doesn't work for me. :-(  This is basically my everyday food habits.   


8:30 am - 10oz. Coffee w/ 1 tsp (confectioners) Swerve + 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream  
9:15 am - 10 oz. Coffee w/ 1 tsp (confectioners) Swerve + 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream  
6:00 pm - 250-450 g Ribeye Steak, 12 oz. Frozen Broccoli, 1 Tbsp Kerrygold butter  
9:00 pm - 100g cheese (cut from a block, Cheddar, Mozz, Swiss, Colby Jack etc)

The only things that really ever change are... sometimes I eat a pork chip instead of ribeye, or cauliflower or Brussels sprouts instead of broccoli. Sometimes I eat a whole big-ass ribeye steak and sometimes I cut it in half. And somedays I eat nothing all day until 6:00 pm, and other days I eat 100g of cheese for lunch, and maybe a handful of pepperonis.  

I don't drink beer or alcohol. I do... from time to time eat another 100 g of cheese later in the night, around 11:00 pm. But this is the problem. I track everything I eat, and I almost never cross over my daily limits for anything. I have my macro goals set for me to loose 2 lbs per week. But even with hitting all my daily goals... I'm only losing 0.55 lbs per week. And... to be honest... I am still pretty damn hungry most of the time. I try to power through... and I drink gallons of water throughout the day so that I can be sure none of my hunger is just misguided dehydration. I think the problem must be the cheese... but I have no idea what else to eat. I think I would lose my mind if I had to prepare some meat &amp; veg every time I wanted something to eat. 

If anyone has any advice... I am all ears. This is so important to me, and I am just so puzzled by how I lost 130 lbs or so when I was in my 20s, by eating thousands of calories every day or cheese, beef, pepperonis... basically 3-4k calories per day of animal protein... while now, I'm staying under 2,1k calories a day, and trying to be damn near perfect with keto... but barely losing anything.

170,unflavored keto-friendly gummy bears?,"Just wondering if something like this exists. Obviously ordinary gummy bears (or gummy-anythings, doesn't have to be in bear shape) are not keto due to the tons of sugar in them. Then they made the sugar-free variety by replacing all of the sugar with sugar alcohols. Unfortunately, this had the side-effect of causing severe intestinal issues if eaten in significant quantity.

So is there some sort of unflavored or mildly-flavored (with **limited** amounts of sugar alcohols) alternative? Mostly I'm looking for the texture/chewiness of traditional gummy bears.",t3_nzb21x

I don't regret this time because I was going through a lot and really needed to rest. Overall, I've been able to maintain my progress but I just don't feel as good. However, it's summer and I would love to lose just a bit more to feel as confident as possible wearing short sleeves, bathing suits, etc. Any tips to get back on the train? I went grocery shopping yesterday to pick up some of my favorites. Stocked up on some eggs, bacon, spinach, deli meat and even my favorite low carb wraps.

177,"M/29/6'2''/268 lbs, keto calorie deficit","First post here, new to this group.  
So I've been 3 weeks into my weight loss journey, only my 4th day on keto. I've mostly been following a low calorie diet over the last couple of weeks. I started working out 3 weeks ago at 286, I was at 273 when I started keto and am now at 268. One thing that concerns me is whether I am overdoing it with the calorie deficit. I am currently going at around 900-1000 calories per day which consists mainly of a 65%F/25%P/10%C diet. I don't feel the urge to eat more, but I am concerned that my intake is on the lower side.

I don't intend to stuff myself for the heck of it, especially if I don't feel hungry or my body doesn't send me the signals. And now since I started keto and counting my macros, those body signals haven't been coming. So I feel reluctant to up my calorie intake to match a certain deficit percentage, especially if my current route gives me weight loss results. I have been feeling a bit woozy over the last couple of days but that seems to be my body adjusting to the new diet.

Do you think I should up my intake just to match a certain daily calorie count, even if I don't feel hungry?",t3_nz1104

Processed meats, fatty meats (salami, beef, hamburger patties, hotdogs, sausage), creamy dressings, onions, jalapenos, pickles, onions (bye bye healthy loaded salads), eggs,  kimchee, spices and pepper, salt including flavored salts like julio's seasoning (aka any mexican food or Mexican wannabe food), nuts, peanutbutter, butter, avocado, coffee, a lot of fruits, garlic, cheese. I can also no longer enjoy types of foods like thai, indian, traditional American (minus the toast and pancakes that I already wasnt eating), etc.

189,Keto is unbelievable!,"I just want to say keto is an actual godsend. 

For the last three years iv tried everything to lose weight and I just havnt been able to.
I tried low carb, exercising non stop, have been on metformin tablets ect and I just kept getting fatter no matter what I tried, so I started researching keto as I heard it helps with diabetes and losing weight. (I am  predisposed my whole family has diabetes on both sides)

So it's been a month and abit of keto and iv lost 5kgs(11lbs) already! Which has just blown me away. 

My diet includes chicken, beef,some cold cuts of meet, lots of different green veggies,avocados, cheeses, some low carb nuts, coconut oil ect - I cut out burgers, pizzas, milkshakes and coca cola ect but I do have a cheeky diet coke every now and then.

I am taking this as an absolute lifestyle switch, not just to lose weight and go back to eating like shit and putting it back on. Not happening! 

But I just want to touch on some unexpected benefits of keto.

Iv had really bad asthma my whole life and I have always struggled to walk up my stairs at home - it is now completely gone. I can do a full on workout now and not be choking on myself. 

My IBS and acid reflux are gone too now!

These 3 diseases I thought I was cursed with forever and now they are all pretty much gone/manageable at the very worst.

Im still 101kgs/222.5lbs and need to lose abit more weight before im at my desired weight but I already feel 100 times more healthy with so much more energy.

Iv even gone out and gotten drunk with vodka sodas and keto didn't make night any worse.

I'm still doing great on keto, but, I don't really have to measure and log all my food.

Eating keto is just natural as can be. No sugar, no starch, no problem! 

For example I might h have 3 fried eggs and 3 thick slice of bacon for breakfast. Lunch might be a salad with a cheeseburger patty, dinner might be keto chili or rotisserie chicken. I know that's less than 20 carbs and, comes pretty close to my protein macro, didn't go over my fat macro either.

192,"Stuck at wits end, not sure where to go next..","**Intro**

Hi All,

I'm stumped, looking to this community to see if there are any suggestions. I've posted about my Plateau before... it's been going on for over a year now but in short here's my story:

I lost 50kg on Keto, going from 125kg to 75kg. This then crept back up to 82kg as for the first time in about 3 years, I came off Keto as I went on Holiday in Asia for a month and ate a load of carbs.

At 82kg I had a Tummy Tuck and Gynecomastia surgery.  This was June 2020.

I came off Keto for the Tummy Tuck, as someone else was cooking for me. Post Surgery I was 86kg. I've since had around 4 Carb Meals, the last one being in Feb 2021. Each time I have a non-keto meal my weight creeps up and I can't seem to get it off.

I'm now around 90/91KG and have been since around Jan 2021

I've really stepped up in the past 2 months. I'm religiously tracking and ensuring I don't overeat, I'm exercising loads (3dpw personal trainer, 2dpw football, long walks, swimming etc) and I've stuck to Keto. 

Still.. no weight loss. If I really restrict my daily calories for a few days I seem to get down to around 89kg but this seems to go back up as soon as I have a day where I don't restrict so much. I'm not talking massive amounts here, I'm talking a few days of eating around 800 calories to go down and then a day of eating maybe 1200 calories to go back up. This suggests to me I'm not actually losing weight but it's just lack of food in my body.

I'm getting worried because, before I went on Keto I was similar. I'd restrict calories, I'd exercise loads and I'd never be able to get below 120kg. It was only when I removed Carbs from my diet that I went on this massive transformative journey. I'm worried that the same thing has happened again except, this time I've already removed the carbs and don't have many other levers.

Last time I posted here the advise was to recalculate macros etc. I did that, I've stuck to it, I've even lowered it massively for a huge deficit.

Is there anything glaringly obvious that I've missed?

&amp;#x200B;

**Specs**

* I'm 31M 5ft8
* I am eating no more than 1200 calories a day, normally less than 800 calories (I've been trialling super low calories for 8 weeks after a recommendation from someone who lost a lot doing it).
* To be more specific about the above, weekdays I'm eating 800 calorie or less. Weekends I tend to go over because of social reasons and end up hitting the 1200 calorie mark.
* I don't feel hungry anymore, I don't feel like I'm starving myself or anything like that.
* A typical day is no more than 12g Carbs. I never eat more than 20g
* My protein intake is way higher than fat, but I am lifting weight in the gym and being encouraged to take in more protein by my trainer. 
* Diet is simple. Eggs, Chicken, Cauliflower, Meat etc
* I drink a lot of Soy Milk, I've cut this out previously with no effect
* I have a personal trainer 3 days a week. I play football 2 days a week. I go swimming 1 day a week. I also go on long walks and I'm generally quite active
* I get at least 8 hours sleep per night, I am not particularly stressed about anything right now.
* I don't have any conditions e.g. Diabetes. I went on Keto for the weight loss benefits purely, although I would guess I was probably pre-diabetic given my old weight.
* I've had blood tests and everything has come back as normal.",t3_nyucky

194,How am I doing?,"The only carbs I eat are my breakfast, which is a couple slices of sourdough toast, about 20g carbs. I can't slather butter on everything due to me having a compromised pancreas. I can still eat loads of fat but I couldn't eat a pepperoni pizza in one sitting or anything. 

for my version of brunch I eat a flax seed omelette, pan-fried in coconut oil and a chicken sausage. I'll usually eat about one avocado a day. Then, for lunch, I'll eat some grass fed ground beef with lettuce wraps instead of taco shells with taco seasoning. Then, I won't eat again until at least 7:30 at night and at that point I'll have canned salmon or sardines, maybe steak and once or twice a week, I'll have some buttered rice or a pasta dish.

 I've lost all of my fat and I have abs for the first time in 20 years and I'm super cut-up looking. I eat loads of broccoli and kale as well as spinach. The only sugars I eat, or rather drink, are Bai drinks which only have 1g sugar each. What would you guys add to this? Is this diet sustainable? Thanks in advance!",t3_nzanw3

I'm thinking about dropping totally hard boiled eggs to be honest.

The downside was that I was able to take with me out on the street and eat it when I was hungry. Now I'm not sure how I could do it, maybe wrapping a fried egg on a toast and taking on the street? Any thoughts on a less warm fried egg toast? Or just a not warm fried egg? Doesn't seem bad but also not that tasty to be honest.

198,Can you guys help me find out the cause of this problem that only happens to me on keto?,"Good day everyone! So, a bit of context: I had absolutely 0 problems with keto until a couple months ago when I had a major diarrhea scenario and, stupidly, didn't hydrate myself. Electrolytes went bonkers and I was feeling pretty bad. After hydrating myself back tho, keto just stopped being the same. Most awful symptoms went away except my current issue: sometime after I eat or drink my ketoade I get this weird sensation on the region of my right eye/forehead. It's not pain, kinda like a burning feeling but not exactly? I don't know How to describe it properly. Anyway, it's very mild and the only thing It accomplished was making me shit my pants in horror that I had some brain problem.
So that fear made me stop keto. I went low carb (50-100) for a month and behold, the sensation was completely gone. I got curious and decided to go back to keto, 2 weeks now, and the feeling has returned... The difference being that i'm ketosis again and drinking ketoade. Does anyone have any clues? Maybe I should stop drinking ketoade?
I appreciate the help cause I live in a small town and no doctors here really understand or approve keto.",t3_nytqn2

201,"A few questions regarding: kidney stones, jittery legs at night, still occasional cramping + more","Hey all,  


I've just been having a few questions I thought some of you might be able to help me with.  


I've been keto for about 10 months (around late august 2020 if I remember correctly). Not doing it for weight loss, but more so for energy. As I always felt tired and sluggish when eating carbs.   


I just have a few questions regarding stuff I came across.   


1. Oxalates: Is it true that if you eat calcium (cheese etc) while eating something with high oxalate content makes the oxalate bind to the calcium and leave the body, instead of staying behind in the body? Would eating cheese or other high calcium foods help prevent kidney stones in this regard?  

2. Jittery/restless legs at night: So, even months before I started keto, I started getting very jittery or restless legs when in bed trying to sleep. I'll get this crazy urge to move my legs, almost beyond my control. Is this a thing on keto too? I consume a ***minimum*** of 12 grams salt, 4 grams LoSalt, and around 700mg magnesium per day. 400mg Magnesium citrate during the day in ketoade, and 300mg magnesium glycinate before bed. Could this still be related to the salts, or perhaps something else?   

3. Cramping: I still get the occasional cramps here and there. Not as much as in the beginning. It's been less since I upped my salt to a minimum of 12 grams + 4 grams Lo Salt, but still occasionally have cramping. It's not a issue for me at all, though, it's not terrible. But I'm wondering if it means I'm still 'too low' on either one of the salts.   

4. Salt in water Vs. salt in/on food: Is there a difference in consuming salt through ketoade or via food? Like, does eating it work better than drinking it?  

5. Is there such a thing as eating too much fat? Sidenote: not doing keto for weight loss, but for energy.   

6. If I still feel sluggish/tired, what could be it, if I still eat/drink/salt enough? Might I need more salts? I'm 6'2ft (1.90m) and weigh 187lbs (85kg)  


Hope some of you can help me out with these questions. Very curious to hear your answers.   


Thank you kindly.",t3_nyt1ca
202,2 weeks back on keto and feeling great,Recently I got a very scary sleep apnea diagnosis that put me on a cpap and made me realize I should probably lose some weight and be healthy for my kids (Apnea unrelated to weight). In my 20s I lost over 100 pounds on low carb doing Atkins but I had given it up and then had two kids that helped to expand my waistline (now 39 yo). Happy to say I am back and have successfully finished two weeks on keto and i am down 5 pounds. Before it seemed like no matter what I did I couldn't lose weight which is apparently a symptom of sleep apnea! With my renewed oxygen level I have been feeling more able to take peloton classes and get exercise. I am really excited to be starting this journey again üòä,t3_nymda0
203,Why does the carb content of 100% dark chocolate vary so much?,"In terms of carb content, at the low end you have [Baker's](https://www.amazon.com/Bakers-Unsweetened-Baking-Chocolate-Squares/dp/B00CHU10X2/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=bakers+100%25+dark+chocolate&amp;qid=1623554830&amp;sr=8-5) with 1g net carbs per 14g. 

And at the higher end you have stuff like [Lindt](https://www.lindtusa.com/wcsstore/LindtStorefrontAssetStore/Attachment/products/nutritional-information-SKU-394002.pdf) with 11g net carbs per 50g, or just over 3g net carbs per 14g to compare to Baker's.

And I've seen everything in between. That's a HUGE variation. I bet there's stuff even higher or lower that I missed.

Note: None of these have added carbs. They're all 100% cacao, and the ingredients all say stuff like Chocolate, Cocoa butter, cocoa processed with alkali, etc.

What's going on? Do various methods of processing chocolate change the carb content? Or are some companies lying on their nutrition facts?",t3_nynuyj

205,Cauliflower Farts,"4+ years Keto &amp; I have yet to acclimate my body to the gut wrenching, marriage ruining, colossal farts that cauliflower anything produces in me.

206,Why does even one teaspoon of sugar take you out of ketosis for a long time?,"I often hear that during nutritional ketosis, having black coffee is okay, but even one teaspoon of sugar will kick you out of ketosis immediately. Then it will take more than 2 hours to get back to ketosis. 

is that true? Why? I mean, we are talking about just a few grams of sugar. For example, if your TDEE is about 100 calories per hour, one teaspoon of sugar (5 grams, 20 calories) is about 12 minutes of your body's caloric needs. Shouldn't the body revert back to ketosis soon after 12 minutes as liver glycogen depletes? Or is there some inertia associated with regaining ketosis?

211,TIP: Don't use Xantham Gum to thicken savory dishes if you like flavour,"Last night I cooked up a bunch of medium ground beef Asian style (Lots of garlic, ginger, onion, thai chillies a little oyster sauce +sesame seed oil and a few dashes of various sauces). It was perfect, right where I wanted it. Then it got to the point where I would usually add a little bit of cornstarch and watter slurry to thicken the sauce...

&amp;#x200B;

But instead of cornstarch and water I used Xantham gum and water to keep my carbs down. I used very little but I find that the Xantham gum and water mixture creates a type of sauce that weakens the whole flavour of the dish. It's hard to describe, but it's like the gum coats all of the seasonings and flavours and sort of makes protective sheild over the food. It ended up being underwhelming :(. The dish was about 4-5 servings so in reality, the 1 tsp of cornstarch would not have contributed more than say 1 gram of carbs/serving.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Xantham gum makes a gel-like coating that prevents the flavour from hitting your tongue. For a large dish, a small bit of cornstarch shouldn't ruin your macros.",t3_ny8u5c
212,Need some advice (hit a plateau),"So I'm pretty familiar with keto.

I just recently started using ketochow (with heavy cream) as a meal supplement at lunch. (I IF from like 9pm to noon the next day).  -&gt; could this be the culprit?

I'm telling myself to hang in there, but it's definitely discouraging after my body was doing so well with it for the last month.

There's no set number, so im playing around with it, keeping it under 20g and still having trouble. I was wondering if anyone else had an illeostomy and could lend me some advice? Its not a medical problem. Not having carbs just makes the illeostomy a big inconvenience rather than an unnoticeable bother. What's your max carb, fellow ostomates?

225,Should I stop when I'm full or should I force myself to eat ?,"Hello,

I started keto more than a month ago, I'm not losing a lot of weight but I am losing and it's good for my health , so I will continue 

I have insulin resistance , I had it for more than 10 years 
I'm overweight but not a lot, my bmi is 26

I'm trying to get healthy but it is a little difficult 

I feel hungry all the time , and I hate the feeling.
I have learned that I need to stop snacking if I want to control my insulin , but it is hard when all what I'm used to do is snack and not eat full meals 

When I start to eat my keto meal I feel super full after eating half of the meal , and it's not a large meal,
and I get super hungry after 2 or 3 hours of eating it 

I started to force myself to finish the whole meal so I feel full longer and it's really tiring to force myself to eat, and I don't even stay full for that long after that, maybe for 5 hours then I will get hungry again 

I'm not sure what should I do 

Should I continue to force myself to eat the full keto meal, even though I will get hungry in few hour even after finishing it.
Or should I just eat a little whenever I'm hungry and stop whenever I'm full, while keeping it keto 

I really want to eat one meal a day or at least 2 , but how am I going to do that, I lived on eating a little bit and snacking throughout the day my whole life , I feel constant hunger especially in the morning , first thing I do when I wake up is eat otherwise I do not feel alive

One pack still has less than 1 carb. 

Out of curiosity I picked up the Stevia to see how the carbs compared and was kind of shocked to see the first ingredient was not maltodextrin, but erythritol! That means it's technically an erythritol blend, and you can deduct the carbs. It also means you might need to watch out if sugar alcohols cause you issues. 

I wish I'd taken a photo but I thought I'd share the info just the same. Read the ingredients because it may vary by store, but it was the first time I saw that in Aldi. Also, it's ONLY the little packets, the big bag of the stuff is either dextrose or maltodextrin. 

Also, it's like $3 a box or so, so a good deal if you use a lot of stevia.",t3_nxupk9
232,"I hateee cooking, can I fulfill my macros by eating almost every food standalone?","I just want to know if I can eat super simple. Simple in the sense of fulfilling my macros by just eating boiled chicken breast. Not much ingredients besides salt and pepper. And then pairing it with other standalone fat products like eating a whole avocado by itself. I know I might sound like a psychopath, but because for me I already hate cooking (I find it tedious and I'm not creative at combining foods) and keto makes finding the right recipes that much more of a headache I want to keep it simple and just get my macros in. The reason why I'm not looking to integrate different foods together like avocado with my chicken breast is because more ingredients in one dish means more complexity and creative effort needed to cook for me. With a regular non keto diet I didn't really watch my nutrition so I didn't have to be super vigilant if things were meeting my macros and whether if that had carbs in it or not. So for Keto, can I eat an avocado by itself and chicken breast by itself and sacrifice the taste without having to overthink on what to cook. Of course some items require combining like butter and stuff and cannot be consumed as a standalone (if you are freaky enough maybe), but butter is easy enough to integrate in cooking for me.

So what I am trying to ask is can I eat everything standalone? Like boiled chicken breast and maybe (at most in complexities of combinations) drizzle some olive oil to meet fat quota. Then eat some steamed veggies. Then eat some source of fat like avocado alone. Or a slice of cheese alone. These would be all consumed in one sitting, but wouldn't be integrated all in one recipe and are all standalone. Would that be effective in nutrition as say combining multiple items with fats, proteins, and veggies in one recipe?",t3_nxzomm
233,52 days in - please tell me if I'm on the right track,"I've been lurking and want to thank everyone for all the information and sharing. It really helps.

I lost 15 lb, but not much in the last two weeks &amp; gained back 1 last week. I weigh my food &amp; count calories &amp; carbs during the day and average about 15-20 carbs and 1000-1200 calories. But in the evening,  in recent weeks I was cheating and taking in 6-8 more carbs per day, still never going higher than 1300 or so on calories. 

I bought a ksafe to limit my access to the problem foods, so any future night time carb cheating is taken care of. 

And I ordered a glucose meter to make sure the low carb tortillas or something else isn't spiking my insulin(Ole Extreme Wellness brand).

234,Can't find a solution to Keto bowel issues,"Hi folks.

Male; 5'9""; Age = 50; SW=203, GW = 170, CW = 181.

I did strict keto from 6/2020 through January 2021 where I lost the bulk of my (small amount) of weight. I've then been messing around with carb amounts, not counting on weekends, some more cheat days in there, etc. Things were pretty much ok but, as expected, the weight loss stopped once the strict counting and adherence stopped. I then had some stress hit in April and my weight ticked up a bit as I was clearly eating too much. Was a low of 174 and now up to 182. So, i'm back on strict again.

That being said, throughout 'phase I"" bowel function was ALWAYS an issue. I never found a groove with normal movements. On and off constipation, had to use suppositories sometimes. Tried psyllium and some ""keto"" electrolyte pills. I take 500mg of Mag Citrate and 400mg Mag Oxide per day as well as 3g of Fish Oil and a men's multivitamin.

What brought me to this post is over this past week + weekend, I was on a vacation where I ate whatever the hell i wanted (except sugar). That meant a few regular sandwiches,basically, and a couple of poke bowls with jasmine rice. Poops were perfect.

Started back on strict this past monday and within 36hrs, all messed up again. I drink 80-120oz of water per day. I do have a diet coke habit and I have a 20oz fountain drink during lunch most days. I also tend to do a 16/8 time-restricted feeding window (whether I'm on keto or not).

Activity-wise, when the weather is good, I mountain bike about 1hr 3-4 days/week. I can get more sedentary in winter with only walking the dog a couple times per week.

Anyway, this bowel thing is the barrier, IMO, to be being in full time 100% compliance, since I love to cook and have adapted to keto requirements in my cooking. I think part of the reason I slip is I want a few days of normal movements. Any thoughts?

thanks.",t3_nxj8fq

Yes, it's more expensive than no lite or lite salt and salt, but I hate drinking salty water, and I'd prefer to avoid flavorings with sugar substitutes to make it palatable.

I figure, as an emergency supplement on those occasional low-electrolyte day could make them stretch out.  Of course, a cheaper alternative would be appreciated. 

Read at least one anecdote of someone burning the lining of their stomach with one of their homemade pills, so not sure about that route.

Magnesium will of course be consumed separately.

I have also been eating a lot less since my 72 hour fast 2 weeks ago so I have been losing weight consistently since then. I have not seen any info about this med being a diuretic, but now I am curious about water weight fluctuations with something that is dehydrating. Is some of that weight loss in the past week is water weight? That would make the fact that I made it to onederland (!!!) this morning much less exciting.

I was on spironolactone a few years ago for 6 months or so, and that is known to be a diuretic. I was not tracking weight before starting but when I stopped it, the scale went up linearly by 10-15 lbs for the 1-2 weeks after with no change in diet, so I felt like the weight I had tracked up to that point should be shifted up by that amount.

1.  Not consuming alcohol at all has helped. I stopped drinking in 2019 for health reasons, I feel that has helped with keto, especially not being tempted by beer. 
2. Stop eating ‚Äúketo‚Äù bread, chips, cake, pizza, etc.It just makes you crave the real thing. Just eat fatty meat and green veg. I tell people ‚Äúpizza was my friend, he‚Äôs dead now RIP‚Äù. That part of your life is over, move on. 
3. Do some research about health, read ‚Äúthe case for keto‚Äù by gary taubes. Understand that there is a compelling argument that keto is how a human should eat. Knowing that you‚Äôre probably doing the right thing helps you stay the course.

255,"2 Months of Keto-Cycling: So Far, So Good","I'm an athletic powerlifter who has always had trouble getting lean.  Even if I tried to very carefully measure food portions, eat clean, I'd always look like I was in a bulk: muscular but not defined. My gf suggested I try keto so I gave it a whirl. 

I've now done 2 months of keto cycling--I'd cut out carbs on Monday, be in ketosis by Wednesday, and then Fr/Sa/Su relax and have some carbs (usually dessert that night).  Results have been good so far:

* Lost 12 pounds/2 inches around my waist, and **no strength loss** (pull-ups have gotten better but that appears to be less weight/more efficient).
* Sleep better.  Prior to keto/low carb I was urninating 3-5 times a night.  Now I can sleep for 5-6 hours straight.
* My muscular endurance plummeted at first--e.g. from doing 12 cycles of very high intensity body-weight exercises (pull-ups+push-ups+air squats) to 8.  That got better in about 2 weeks and I am back to where I was.  This week for example I rolled (BJJ fighting) for 3, 5-minutes rolls back to back, two of those against an absolute stud SF guy 20 years younger than me.
* I miss fruit, but that's really it.  Nuts/avocado/eggs/chicken wings/steak/butter/olive oil/broccoli/brusseles etc. are pretty satisfying.

One interesting thing I've noticed is that the last 2 weeks I have **not** gone into ketosis (added more green vegetables and onions), but the weight loss is still steadily happening.  

I'd welcome suggestions from more experienced folks.  It does seem clear to me that my body does not do well with even a moderate amount of cards, despite training seriously 5x per week.  Keto/low carb (so far) seems to be much better for me.",t3_nxh4c1

I eat tons of cheese, meat, eggs, and quite a bit of ""keto"" products. I know there are folks who don't but it works for me.

262,So I suck at keto. Hopefully it will work for me from now on.,"So basically, I've been on keto for about 2 months now, and my weight hasn't changed even a bit.

I do believe I know the cause, which I discovered recently. I don't actually eat that much of 'normal' keto food, so I do believe I was in big calorie deficit, as I only ate one decent-sized lunch.

I am new to long-term keto, so I was trying to follow the basic advice of 'don't count the calories, just try to stay in keto/count the carbs'.

Now that I'm comfortable in keto (quite low hunger levels compared to normal diet), I am trying to figure out why I haven't lost my weight. The culprit seems to be... my snacking on peanut butter.

I knew peanut butter had a lot of calories, but I didn't realise just how much. At dinner time, I usually had hunger cravings that wouldn't easily go away, so I would snack on 'a bit of' peanut butter. This would usually end up being 150-200g of peanut butter easily. That's 1.2k calories from peanut butter alone. This in connection with my lunch, would probably put me in my normal calorie count.

I don't know why, but I haven't realised this before, if I did, I would've tried to obtain my fats/snacks some other way, but I guess thanks to this I've been able to keep doing keto without too much hassle.

Since past couple of days, I am just cooking bigger lunch, and I have leftovers for when I start getting hungry again. My lunch is very 'dietic', as it contains shirataki noodles instead of normal noodles, vegetables, just a little bit of meat, and alfredo sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

I really also would like to try OMAD, but so far, I've been unsuccessful due to high levels of hunger couple of hours before bed time.

And I really, really, REALLY wish my weight will start to drop now, as I have high hopes for ketogenic diet. I am obviously obese, and my problem my entire life was that I was always hungry, regardless of what I was eating. Even after getting semi-full, I'd feel hungry. 

This craving for food is lowered on keto.  

On ordinary diet, I would be feeling 5/10 to 10/10 for most of my day. In keto I would mark it anywhere between 0/10 to 5/10 for most of the day. 

I have been enjoying this change for the past 2 months, and I am trying to continue keto despite literally zero options for delivery in my town, and having to homecook everything.

I wasn't going to post again until I lost 80 pounds.  I've lost 60 so far (480 down to 419).   I just wanted to post because of something I hear all the time from people, and that is that the keto diet is ""unhealthy"".

Both my wife and I are on Keto. We started on Dec 8th, and so far I have lost 60 pounds, and gained 12 pounds of muscle (based on my doctors BMI health scale).  My wonderful wife joined my keto battle as support and has lost 50 pounds.

For me, my blood pressure has always been high.  Ever since college my low number has been in the 90s.  When I started in December, my bp was 145/98.  At my most recent doctor visit it was 135/88. Yes, still a little high, but so much better.  

My wife has been battling with high cholesterol numbers for a very long time.  Everyone has told her how unhealthy Keto is, and she was afraid of what her numbers where going to be.  She just got her cholesterol numbers back, and her numbers have drastically improved.  Her doctor has been urging her to go on cholesterol meds for a while because they keep creeping up.  Her numbers are well within the normal range now.  (Her good cholesterol number could go up a few points, but is still in the normal range.)  Her Blood pressure has gone back to normal numbers.  Her doctor is saying that it's a great change, and to keep doing what we are doing.  He says she no longer needs to consider medication.  Drastic improvement.",t3_nwr7xi
265,Got my sleep back,"
After speaking to multiple sleep specialists and sleep studies and nothing working, I had a hunch I may be suffering seizures that wake me up at night. I had sleep maintenance insomnia starting 5 years back. I also suffered a fibril seizure when I was born. I have been on strict keto for the past 3 days and for the first time that I can remember in past 5 years, I've slept through the night for a full 7 hours. I can't say for certain since it's been 3 days I've been seeing this miracle but already feel grateful to have found keto. Praying this miracle continues.",t3_nwqjl0

268,Not your usual 'I'm restarting keto' post!,"Hello everyone - I don't post often but thanks very much for letting me lurk here.  I learn so much and I love reading everyone's stories.  Please bear with me for a long post of my own.  I feel the need to share it for some reason and I figure you guys may understand. 

So I've restarted keto.  I originally started keto three and a half years ago, I lost 30+ Kg, reached my goal weight and maintained on keto after that, plus or minus a Kg or two.  All was good and I thought I was keto for life.

Then at the end of last year I was unexpectedly diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer.  Which sucked.  I went into hospital for some tests and got kept in as a patient on chemotherapy.  Needless to say, with hospital food and other things on my mind, my diet wasn't the best.

Then I had to go back to hospital for a month having a stem cell transplant.  Not fun.  I couldn't eat for days at a time due to nausea and when I did eat I often promptly threw it up again.  I had the doctors and nutritionists trying to force any sugar and protein into my system to give my body energy and keep it fighting.   It was good for me at the time.

Things are better now and I'm back home, but I realised that I'd kept the 'calories at any cost' mentality for food.  I was eating a lot of junk, at all the wrong times. I felt bloated and uncomfortable after eating (and usually eating too much). I'd put on 9-10 Kg, which isn't the most important thing but it meant my clothes didn't fit and I just felt wrong.

So a couple of weeks ago I finished off my pizza, tipped my sugary sports drink down the sink, went shopping for meat and vegetables and eggs and restarted keto.  And I feel great now.  I haven't lost much weight yet, but that's not too critical.  Plus I'm still on chemotherapy and taking a load of chemo drugs and steroids, and Lord knows what they do to your metabolism.   But:

- I don't feel bloated and uncomfortable any more
- my energy levels are much more constant and even across the day - no slumps
- my energy levels are higher overall and I'm much more active
- I'm sleeping better at night 
- I feel mentally sharper and more fluent again

And I'm eating much better too.  For me, keto forces fairly clean eating.  No processed junk.  Meat, lots of green vegetables, eggs, cheese, butter, coffee.  Most of my food doesnt even have an ingredients list on the packet.  Compare that to a meat feast pizza.  The keto way has to be healthier, right?

Most importantly, I've taken control again of one aspect of my health and my life, and I feel better for it.  I'm in charge now, not the junk food.  I read a lot of stories here from people who are going through all sorts of challenges, both mental and physical and worse than mine.  We can't always choose what happens to us, but we can choose how we respond to them.  In my case, getting back onto my preferred way way of eating is a small step to take control and make a change for the better.  For anyone thinking about the keto lifestyle, stop thinking, dive into it and do it too.  You won't regret it.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading, thanks for letting me get this off my chest and good luck on your own journey!


TL:DR - Life sucks sometimes.  We can't always choose what happens to us.  But we can all choose how we respond.  Eating keto is a small way to take control and make a change for the better.  If you're thinking about it, do it now!",t3_nwkm6l

274,Keto while travelling,"Hi!

I am planning a road trip within the UK in about a month and want to stick to the diet during the trip and I don't want to depend on restaurants, which aren't always reliable when it comes to keto. So, I thought why not open a thread to compile a list of keto-friendly foods that are portable and do not spoil in the summer heat. 

The criteria for the food items are as follows:

* Does not require refrigeration
* Does not easily spoil
* Does not require cooking 
* Preferably a whole food (avoid over-processed items like keto chips and beef jerky)
* Protein-rich is a plus (nuts are a great portable calorie-dense food but they lack sufficient protein).

What I have in mind are the following:

* Nuts (brazil and pecan) 
* Seeds (sunflower and pumpkin)
* Canned fish 
* Some kinds of cheese

What else? Please feel free to suggest items within or outside the above categories.",t3_nx2lul
275,Headaches on keto?,"I want to preface this by pointing out that this is not my first rodeo. I was very successful with keto which I started a decade ago and kept up with for several years. 
I was at my ideal weight and felt great physically and mentally. Then a bunch of major events in my life happened and in 2017 I gradually fell off the wagon and regained all of the extra weight I had lost.

Fast forward to this year, after being diagnosed with insulin resistance and pre-diabetes I restarted keto on May 17th. I'm doing great so far. I don't do the scale, but according to my last doctors check up I weighed 73kg (161lbs for my American friends). Now 3 weeks in my clothes are getting loose and I notice more defined mid-section. Yay for that!
I don't count calories and carbs but mostly eat protein and fat with low-carb vegetables and a cherry or berry here and there. Usually just one largish meal a day, because I'm not hungry the rest of the time.
Also I walk minimum of 10k steps each day.

However I notice over the last week or so I get slight headaches which continue for hours on end. I'm having one as I type this.

I'm not saying and I'm not certain they are related to this way of eating, but I didn't have them so frequently before.

Has anyone else been having this issue while in ketosis? 
Could my headaches be caused by not adequate hydration? I have to admit I don't drink a lot of water and other acceptable liquids and I'm trying to work on that.
Also I wanted to add that I've had the occasional lightheadedness in the years back while on keto, but not frequent headaches like what I'm dealing with now.",t3_nwx1cj

My knowledge about health was so low I'm so proud of how much I know now. The first month I was very strict with tracking my calories and macros on MyFitnessPal but this month I have been really lazy but still successful lol!

I am fortunate to have a keto bakery near me and I shop on an e-commerce store to  buy amazing ""keto"" bread and keto snacks. (I live in Canada and recommend using: [naturamarket.ca](https://naturamarket.ca) and my fav keto bread that is 40cals is by Carbonaut). 

Thing is, I still alternate between dirty and clean keto. I get my healthy fats from eggs, meats, avocados, chia seed pudding, salads full of hemp and flax seeds. To keep my sanity, i eat Keto ice cream by Enlightened, Magic Spoon keto cereal and keto chips like pork rinds and cheese whisps from Costco. I also find that drinking 0 calorie sodas help me stay full and doing IF16:8 (or &lt;8) helps the weight melt off. (I drink Zevia and bubly but I always add sweetener to the later)

I also love breakfast: egg pizzas (look up cloud bread), keto bagels/bread, magic spoon cereal and keto cream cheese pancakes.

277,Birthday 2020 v. 2021: 56 pounds down and I feel like a different person,"Birthdays are great milestones in all our lives. The same is the case with me. I turned 28 yesterday. 

Back in June 2019 and June 2020 - I weighed around 122 kilos roughly. I was morbidly obese and that led to a lot of unhappiness and dissatisfaction in my life. 

It‚Äôs been 7 months since I started working on my weight and a whole year has passed since my last birthday.

I weigh 24 kilos (55ish pounds) lesser now. My weight has been stagnant for over 3 months now but that‚Äôs entirely on me. I haven‚Äôt been able to keep up with my fasting regime or dietary restrictions or workouts. So I can‚Äôt expect miracles to happen. 

However, this feels like an achievement still. This feels good. It is nice to know that I have a waist isn‚Äôt larger than my chest anymore. 

It is nice to have the confidence to wear sleeveless clothes and skirts. 

I don‚Äôt feel the need to hide myself under the bulk of clothes anymore. 

I feel like going out more. Celebrating. Wearing better clothes. Looking better. 

I feel more and more confident. I feel more healthy. 

Anyway. Without digressing I‚Äôm going back on a strict disciplined program for myself from tomorrow. Nothing major, just no junk food, less sugar and a whole lot of physical activities. 

Thank you everyone. For motivating me with your beautiful pictures and words. You guys have been a big part of this journey.

These foods included buttered toast, butter noodles, ramen, chicken broth(no replacement needed for this), crackers, and of course a wife range of sweets.

I would greatly appreciate any help with simple replacements. I don't need keto breads, but something I can put in that toast shaped hole until the hole isn't toast but something better. 

My declining mental health and lack of sleep makes doing anything that means spending my effort of myself feel like a waste. I am trying to fight it, but a few very simple foods would be amazing.

My son's covid test came back positive Monday and now I have all the same symptoms. My question is, what is the procedure for fighting off a viral infection of this type on keto?

I got sick Tuesday (migraine, fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting sore throat and chest pain) and since then pretty much have only had chicken bone broth with some extra sea salt and water.
I'm just trying to help this out of my system as quickly as possible so I can get back to normal... any advice would be helpful. TIA",t3_nwfgv2
314,How do you plan out what to eat?,"I'm not new to dieting and have basically tracked calories for the last 10 years. I'm planning to start keto now and I'm getting overwhelmed trying to plan out my days while worrying about the carbs and calories. 

Currently, I meal plan our suppers each week and then I build the rest of my day around that. I.e. if we're having a big or high calorie dinner, I'll skip breakfast or eat a light lunch. If I get to dinnertime and I'm too high for the day, I'll have a smaller portion for dinner. 

So I'm sitting here trying to plan out breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the week. I feel like not only do I have to figure out WHAT to eat, but I also have to figure out the net carbs in each meal so I know I'm on track. I realize this wil get easier as I learn more but does anyone have advice for getting started? 

I macros said to do 26g carbs, 96g protein, and 106g fat. And I'd like to aim around 1500 calories. Should I try to do like 5g carb breakfast and lunch, 10g dinner and the rest for snacks?

316,Calorie Deficit Question Keto,"Hi all, recently I've started keto and I'm loving the change in mood and energy it brings. The only thing I'm concerned about is reaching a 'calorie deficit' daily. My daily caloric intake is 2062 and I have no problem meeting that if not coming in a little under. BUT I am struggling to burn that + the 20% deficit needed to lose weight. Is my understanding correct that to lose a good amount of weight I will need to BURN 2,400 calories a day while CONSUMING 2,062 calories? Taking into account my resting calories I'm only just breaking 1,200 calories a day with my 40 minute workout after work. I'm usually destroyed by the time I get home around 6:30pm after being at work since 7:30am. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.

317,First trip to McDonald's on keto,"https://imgur.com/gallery/KFZvjWY

My kids wanted the BTS meal, so I decided to order the McDouble with no bun, no ketchup, and extra pickles and onions.

I was wondering how they were going to wrap this, because McDoubles usually come wrapped in wax paper, and this is how it came. A little wasteful, but what the heck? Much better than having the cheese stick to the wrapper.

I was pleasantly surprised by the free lettuce too. Normally, they charge extra for lettuce on a McDouble. I guess they figured I was going to eat this like a salad.

With the lettuce, this was just special sauce away from a Big Mac, so I whipped some up with:

* Sir Kensington Avocado Mayo
* Dill relish (actual Mac sauce uses sweet relish)
* Yellow mustard
* Onion powder
* Garlic powder
* Paprika
* Pyure liquid stevia
* White vinegar

I assembled everything on a toasted Franz Keto hamburger bun, and it tasted pretty close to the real thing. I hope Franz eventually starts selling sesame seed keto buns. That would have made it just a little bit better.",t3_nw4r3r

I'm doing really well, keeping my carbs down and meeting my intake goals for protein/fat (for the most part, I'm a bit below the goal every day but that's also because I know my metabolism is a bit slower than my calorie counter is giving me credit for). 

However, I've been really struggling with cravings. Sure I'll get the occasional hankering for french fries or cookie dough, but the persistent, torturous need is fruit. I desperately want to eat a box of strawberries or a nice tomato or something! How have any of you defeated this craving? Satisfied the need for juicy fruit??

Throughout the day, I of course kept feeling a bit self-conscious: Does my face look okay? Does this dress suit me? Will they think it‚Äôs weird if I only order water and don‚Äòt eat any of the carby food? But as the day went on, those thoughts moved to the back of my mind. One of my friends said ‚ÄûYou know, you‚Äòve changed so much since last year, I would probably not have recognized you on the street.‚Äú It‚Äôs true - I‚Äôve lost 42kg/92lbs since the last time they saw me. I must look so different now.

I‚Äòve worked so hard on myself these past few months - not only in terms of losing weight, but also generally on reducing my self-hatred and trying to not put myself down all the time. There is still a long way to go; I still get anxious around people, I still feel self-conscious about my appearance.

For me, bbq sauce is a big one because one serving can pack a whopping 18+ carbs. In the past I tried G Hughes and thought it was pretty decent, but a little sweet for my taste. It was fine but it didn't have the kind of ""zing"" I liked. so I'd usually cut it with sriracha.

That brings me to Sweet Baby Ray's. For starters, a big plus is that it's carried at the local supermarket right with all the other sauces and condiments, and for the same price as the fully sugared version (I can only find G Hughes at Walmart locally). It's sweetened with allulose, and one serving has 4 carbs, but you can actually deduct most of that because they need to label allulose as a carb. Even at face value, though, 4 carbs should fit into pretty much any diet, even keto.

But all of that means nothing without describing the taste. As I said, the G Hughes is pretty good, but it wasn't something I would reach for unless I had a craving. This stuff though? It's the real deal. If you already like Sweet Baby Ray's, honest to god, the flavor is indistinguishable (at least to me). Allulose has no aftertaste and it tastes pretty much exactly like sugar, so this stuff is GREAT, and it doesn't spike my blood sugar (I'm diabetic, so I would know)! It's so good I've started using it in place of ketchup on my burgers and hot dogs, which has made cookouts a real pleasure.

So if you see this stuff in the supermarket and you miss BBQ sauce, give it a shot. It's good enough that you may not need to buy the sugared stuff for the rest of the family!",t3_nvk5kq
346,Unintentionally had regular soda,"A mini vent, I guess. 

Mentally and emotionally, I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm not beating myself up about not knowing better. I know that mistakes get made. Mix-ups happen.

I‚Äôm not even upset that I have 5 pounds of water weight back immediately.

What I‚Äôm truly struggling with is the way I feel physically. Cravings are back full force after months of none. Discipline has dwindled. I feel like shit. I feel irritable. I truly feel terrible physically. My face is flushed, my knees are on fire, and I just don‚Äôt feel well at all. It‚Äôs crazy to think it‚Äôs from just one soda when I used to drink 5+ a day.

358,"3 weeks on keto, no weight loss.","Hi group. :-)

I am a male, 46yo, 104 kilos, 187cm high. 
I've done keto before with great succes, but this time it's different. Weight won't budge. 

In 2019 i was 124 kilos and with keto i got down to 93 kilos in 3 months. 
In 2010 i lost 8kilos in 1 month. 

I eat... 
A box of canned tuna with some mayo for breakfast
A salmon filet, 250grams broccoli, 10 olives and cheese with a dash of oyster sauce for dinner
3 boiled eggs with mayo a few hours before bed.

I vary these around, but this is what i eat for the last 3 weeks. Earlier, i would have lost 5-7 kilos by now.

I also stopped drinking alcohol a week ago. I suspect that also could be a culprit.

I had a servere heart failure in 2017, so i got the belly to go with that, and i want it gone, now that my health is more or less back due to biking.

I bought a smart weight (love it) and it confirms visceral above high. (inside and outside belly fat).

Never had any problems on keto before. Also, i am drinking 2,5 litres of water every day.

Does anyone have an idea what i could be doing wrong? 3 weeks now, weight still the same 104kilos.",t3_nvvtve

I know that this time is going to work for me. I'm staying strong so far, I just wanted some advice on whether my macros were correct. I've used a few different calculators and got different numbers for each of them so I've just averaged them out. I'm a 6ft male weighing in at 130kg (286lbs). I've gone for 5% (27g) carbs, 30% (155g) protein and 65% (149g) fat with my calories at 2,062. My blood pressure is quite high as well so I'm hoping to lower this. I usually come in 80-100 calories under which I'm not mad about. I also do a 25 minute incline fast walk + 20-30 mins of lightish weight lifting after work and this absolutely ruins me. I will eventually work my way up to jogging and more intense weight lifting. I'm a car salesman so I'm quite sedentary during the day.

368,Stomach and caffeine issues after 10wks in keto,"So I‚Äôve been into intermittent fasting for years (usually split as some form of 16/8 or 20/4) and for the past several months I‚Äôve basically been doing OMAD (22/2ish).

I‚Äôve also been experimenting off and on  with low carb/keto for the past year or two, and have been doing a keto diet for the past 10 weeks or so, though I‚Äôll often have a day a week where I eat and drink mostly whatever (usually on Saturday due to social pressure - bday parties, drinking, etc.).

The transition into ketosis has always been horrible, but I‚Äôve usually come out the other side and experienced all the amazing benefits of keto (energy, mood, weight loss, etc.).

Now I also love coffee. I‚Äôve had black coffee most days for the past many years (1-2 cups a day on avg). When I get keto flu I often notice caffeine metabolism issues and have to back off on my coffee, but that‚Äôs always temporary.

In the past week or so though, ive started getting bad stomach pain/nausea - an uncomfortable stomach and liquidy stool. I‚Äôve also been feeling low energy, foggy, a bit down, and just generally slow. If I drink any caffeine, my stomachs gets horribly upset and I get pretty bad headaches. Even switching to green tea is still causing these problems.

I‚Äôve always tried to be good about taking electrolytes, though I haven‚Äôt been quite as good recently. So maybe this is a problem but I‚Äôd be surprised since I‚Äôm still taking them most days.

Anyone have any idea what‚Äôs going on? Could it just be dehydration? Seems a little weird given im usually OK about managing dehydration but maybe that‚Äôs it. 

Usually the longer into keto I go the better I feel, but now I feel like im regressing and im not sure how to fix it.

Anyone have similar experiences or advice or any idea?",t3_nvebtk

If you only eat protein would you achieve this effect still? I know this isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúHGH sub‚Äù but just curious if there‚Äôs anyone who has some insight in here since we tend to have similar goals

Particularly for me this is after doing sprints and some calisthenics and 5 miles walking, having not eaten anything since 5pm being now 9:51pm, and that really just being some light snacking on cheese, my main protein packed meal at 8-8:30AM, I would have a decent fast going on for HGH boost if I didn‚Äôt eat it sounds like.

373,"A week in and five pounds down‚Äîit ain't much, but it's honest work","June 1st, I moved out of my parents' place and started keto (one didn't happen because of the other but I find it much easier to monitor what I eat when I don't have temptations/are forced to make my own meals).

For years, I've been such an overeater. I love food, I love fast food esp and junk food and everything lol. I eat when I do homework, I eat when I'm bored, I eat when I'm out, I eat when I relax, I eat to socialize, etc. I'm young and I was pretty okay weight-wise for a while so it didn't really affect me. When I started college I was 130lb. Then I was 140lb when I finished first year. Then pandemic hit and I got to 145lb. And these past several months, I shot up to 151lb, officially becoming overweight by BMI standards.

I know my weight gain or loss isn't anything extreme, especially compared to all the people here losing hundreds. But this past week, I've been making my own keto meals,  working out and I already feel and see the difference. I'm starting to fit comfortably into my clothes again. I don't feel bloated. I'm starting to like what I see in the mirror. And most of all: I don't feel hungry anymore.

I am stunned. Never in my life have I ever not had the urge to not eat. I thought I would miss the food I used to love (I ate pizza everyday) esp pasta and rice and fried food...but I don't. WTF.

So...this actually works?? For me?? I am stunned. And so happy.

The only bad side is I feel tired more, but I'm drinking a lot of water and getting my salt in. Also, I feel awkward and weird telling people about it, esp friends because I feel like everyone is pretty judgmental. Like I promise you, I'm not starving myself. I am simply not hungry!",t3_nuvmt2

382,Dealing with sugar addiction when certain keto look-alike foods seem to contribute to binging,"Hi all, I'm a real sugar addict. I feel way better on Keto, but remain addicted to quest bars and the like - even keto imitation bread seems to set me off. I can binge eat anything that resembles carbs. Also nuts and nut butter. I could spend all my calories in a day (and more) on 12 quest bars, if I'm in the right mood.

So about a week ago I decided to try stopping consuming all foods that were meant to look like non keto foods, e.g. bars, breads, etc, as well as nuts and nut butter. Still allowing SF syrups in coffee and diet soda.

383,Please say no.,"So, I've been doing this keto thing for a bit, (around three months) on and off, and finally, around five days ago, decided enough was enough, and I wanted to become serious and respect my real desire of staying on the diet for more than 36 hours. So, since then I've been counting carbs, some days net, some days gross, all days trying to remain between 15g and 42g. I do cardio in the morning every day so this limit seemed practical to remain in keto. ANYHOW, I've been going to barnes &amp; nobles every day for about two weeks now, and have been ordering the same thing: hot green tea in water. And became a bit suspicious that the tea bag/drink may actually contain sugar, so I ordered it ""unsweetened."" That didn't settle my uneasiness as I began to hound the barista to be sure it only contained water and the tea bag. Got the drink, took it to my seat, and went straight to google. Mind you, I haven't been feeling the insulin response of dizziness every time I stand, and haven't seen the initial water/carb weight shed since i've began - and usually that happens for me in the first two days. This is what caused my suspicion. RESUME! So I head back to all knowing Google and discover that Green Tea unsweetened from starbucks already has 32g of sugar pre-sweetened (?). Can someone please confirm if this is true or not?

I want to get down to be around 160, so I have a heavy goal to achieve. My big treats are chobani and atkins bars. Last night I had one of the salted caramel chobanis. They're 25 carbs so I was a little over my keto allotment but it feels like a heavy punishment for a tiny bit of sweetness.

Like a lot of people who don't initially love kale, I found it too bitter or plain. But the thing that got me hooked was finding a salad dressing that complimented everything in the bowl wit ha sweet touch and low to no sugar.

First it was [Bolthouse Farms Organic Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing](https://www.fredmeyer.com/p/bolthouse-farms-organic-raspberry-balsamic-vinaigrette-dressing/0007146401947). Easy to find in stores, reasonably priced, semi-clean ingredients, and passably low-carb/sugar for what I was doing.

Sadly, Bolthouse Farms discontinued the organic dressing line...

But then I found the [Cleveland Kraut Sweet Beet Dressing](https://www.clevelandkitchen.com/products/sweet-beet). Same nutrition positives, a big bottle that lasted me a week, very clean ingredients, available at Target and Whole Foods...

The produce manager at Target just told me that it's going to be discontinued in the coming months.

**At the intersection of convenience, health/nutrition, pricing, and availability, is there a sweet salad dressing that is Keto/Whole30 friendly?**",t3_nv6wgk

389,I think I've asked this before: mental illness,"So I'm mentally ill after abusing amphetamine and mdma in high school


Maybe I was predisposed, maybe it was the drugs It doesn't matter


Alot of days I can function but i don't have drive or the ability to focus. I don't care about ,feel, yet if you were to talk to me I would seem normal. It really varies day to day

I also struggle with sleep problems, brain fog , obsessive and irrational thoughts,  and sometimes I'm a little bit irrational and hyper/manic but not much

Most of the time I'm just flat. I have to drag myself through workouts and work

I fast alot, only drink tea and water, and eat paleo

It's been 5 years.


I'm sorry if I'm not supposed to ask this here, but I'm trying to learn everything I can about mental illness



Is keto a suitable treatment for this? 

If I do meds I'd rather not eat such a strict diet. But if keto gives me the ability to heal my brain and feel better I'm down to stick to it if it means not getting on medication

I'm in-between providers and struggling to find a good one.


I know nothings a cure all and I'm pretty sure I have my lifestyle down its just sometimes I'm like cognitively not present, very awkward,  and can't talk to people. Sometimes I just babble stupid shit and act rediculous

I've lost alot of friends due to ""a lack of social awareness"" and doing things that upset them. It feels like I've lost the ability to think things through


I struggle to make up my mind, stick with school or a job, or have a girlfriend as most people just think I'm weird..

I'm back and forth everyday on what I should do.. Will medication help?? Or is keto a better bet.


I'm so scared of medication and want to make sure my provider is treating me correctly ifnthats the route I take. I also worry like stimulants ( to modulate dopamine) will make me feel like bad.

Also coming off of meds in the future or if my brain adjusts.

I need help. What to do?

So I'm not as organized as I would like to be starting Keto. But since day 1, 6/6/21, I've eliminated all carbs all together and very limited vegetables and have been mostly eating eggs/egg yolks, heavy cream+butter coffee, clean ground beef, good salmon,  don't eat much at all, don't eat until maybe 11am-1pm, then might have a light meal at 5pm then nothing before bed. 
One thing I've experienced that worries me a little is a major increase in palpitations. At least one a day and before it was here and there a few times in few months span. I've been doing some research and can't get a good answer on why exactly I'm dealing with these. Could anybody give me a more scientific explanation on why I'm experiencing these.

I seem to be making progress finally by taking Magnesium glycinate several times a day in small doses. Big improvements in energy and mood. But I still find that I am sleeping weird. Since starting keto a few months ago, I usually wake up every couple of hours or am in a strange half sleep.

394,"3.5 months of Keto - amazing results, but have questions","Background: Mid 30's, fasting blood sugar was 110, blood pressure elevated 137/81 at February doctor's visit. Was 6'2'' 214 pounds (27.5 BMI). I went on not completely strict keto diet -- not counting carbs to the carb after the first few weeks of counting everything, but averaging around 15-30 net carbs per day.  


I'm down to 186, so lost 28 pounds. BMI is about 24, blood pressure is checked a few times a week and averaging 116/77, and I've been tracking my blood sugar with a continuous monitor for the past month. Average blood sugar is 89, with fasting anywhere between low 80's and low 90's (early morning or sometimes during the night). Only a few times in the past month has my blood sugar been over 110, and the highest it got was 141 after eating two pieces of cake and ice cream (was trying to test a high sugar / carb input).

Obviously, I am happy with where things have gone, but I have some questions about where to go from here.

  
1. My doctor was terrible - basically just said ""don't eat as much sugar"" after the last visit. Besides get a new doctor, what tests should I be requesting at my check in later this summer? Do I need to do a glucose tolerance test? Are there other tests that could be important given where I was and where I am now?

2. The times I've eaten carb heavy (for keto) meals, I've noticed it really takes a long time for my blood sugar to spike. If I ate 25g of carbs, it actually doesn't start climbing until about 1-1.5 hours after the meal, and might hit the peak 2.5 hours later, before getting back to normal maybe 3.5-4 hours post meal. I've also noticed that it's not uncommon after eating for my blood sugar to go down 5-10mg 5-30 mins after eating, before normalizing (no/very low carb) or rising (low/medium carb). Is this meaningful in any way?

3. Where to go from here: there is no chance I will slip back into poor diet and bad eating. The benefits have been eye opening and I have learned about all the health risks I was subjecting myself to by being overweight with poor vitals. But I would like to try a little more moderate diet. I know my body is at a minimum still recovering from insulin resistance, I'm trying to decide 1) the best time to start a more moderate diet - give my body more time to heal? and 2) the best path for trying that. It's honestly daunting thinking about going back to eating more carbs as the few times I have eaten even a moderate amount, I feel fairly terrible.

398,[Question/Advice] Keto Eating During Times of Tummy Trouble,"I‚Äôve been keto just over 3 months and have had good success this far. I‚Äôve lost over 50lbs, dropped my A1C from 8.9 to 5.3, and overall feel so much better than before. 

Unfortunately, in the last couple weeks I‚Äôve had to start new medication that is wreaking havoc on my stomach. I‚Äôm nauseous or queasy most of the time, been sick a few times, have transient episodes of stomach cramping, ZERO appetite, and general stomach upset. Eating has become a struggle and keto foods have been especially difficult to keep down. 

Before keto, with an upset stomach I might have had some crackers or toast or rice or oatmeal until my stomach settled, but those are no longer an option. 

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of what I call ‚Äúincidental‚Äù fasting and my energy has been fine overall, but this constant feeling of upset is a bummer. There does come a point where I need to eat something, but I‚Äôm running out of ideas. My stomach rejects most meat and anything high fat. 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has been through similar and has any suggestions of what I might be able to eat while staying keto as my body adjusts to this medication. I need to give it at least another 7-10 days before I can abandon it and try a different medication, but the entire class has the same kind of side effects, so I‚Äôm trying to stick it out. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

406,"Blood sugar down, weight up??? (success and frustrations)","Hello, I'm a 33yo man with type 2 diabetes. For the longest time my doctor's advice was to manage my weight and diet which I did successfully for a while going from 360lbs in 2019 to 320 in 2020. Even after COVID closed all the gyms I still managed to keep my weight stable but I started experiencing sharp pain in my joints which I attributed to nerve damage. I decided to start keto and practically overnight all joint pain stopped.

So 2020 was a bit of a rollercoaster as I would keto for a month or two then go back to my regular diet, still maintaining a weight of \~320 but no longer experiencing pain. At the beginning of May I hit a new low of 313lbs but my blood sugar is higher than I would like it to be so I decide to hop back on keto and measure the change.

Well I'm happy to say that over 30+ days I've cut my blood sugar down by over 30%! Then I step on the scale: 325lbs what the actual fuck?!

I wish I could understand what's happening here. On keto I weigh and measure my food, track my macros, and even work out more. 12 pounds in a month can't be water weight, can it? I've only started taking waist measurements and those don't seem to have changed, I don't notice any snugness in my clothing, but where the hell is this extra weight coming from?

I can't deny it's disheartening. On one hand I do believe keto will help me manage my condition without medication but on the other hand stepping on the scale every morning is a blow to my self esteem and I'm trying to prioritize my blood sugar over my weight to keep from falling back to old habits but those old habits actually saw me lose weight without trying.",t3_nugwba

Tortillas: Mission Carb Balance tortillas (4 net carbs) are pretty close and I‚Äôve heard frying them in oil can make pretty good replacement chips

Chocolate chips: Lily‚Äôs baking chips 

Bread: Aunt Millie‚Äôs Carb Smart white bread (1 net carb per slice) and I refrigerate it bc apparently keto bread gets moldy pretty fast

Ice Cream: tbh anything Breyers Carb Smart is a win, especially the fudge bars and vanilla ice cream

Ketchup: Heinz sugar free tastes exactly the same as regular to me


I‚Äôm also (naively) hoping there might be a better flour substitute than almond flour or coconut flour. Any other suggestions?

Male SW: 256, CW: 250, GW: 150, Height: 5'8"" . I started keto about 3 weeks ago. I have about once a week done a 24-36 hr fast as well. My net carbs have been around 25-30gm and overall 1500-1600 calories. My brunch is usually scrambled eggs with some spinach and mushroom mixed in the eggs and cali'flour pizza base (like a burrito stuffed with the eggs and veggies) [https://califlourfoods.com/products/traditional-original-italian](https://califlourfoods.com/products/traditional-original-italian) (half a pizza base) and some leafy greens (shaved brussel sprouts or brocolli usually, sometimes asparagus)- so about 3gm net carbs from pizza base and  3-4gm carbs at best from the veggies (for a total of 600 calories meal). I follow it with a Love Good fats bar [https://lovegoodfats.com/products/peanut-butter-chocolatey-keto-bar](https://lovegoodfats.com/products/peanut-butter-chocolatey-keto-bar) which is typically 5gm net carbs and 200 calories. For my second meal, I have a Green Chef keto meal subscription going on [greenchef.com](https://greenchef.com) which usually is a 10-12 net carbs and &lt;=800 calories meal. So I believe I'm at about 1500-1600 calories. I have to say that my lifestyle for the past 1.5 years has been completely sedentary and even for the last 3 weeks I havent really been going out much for walks or anything.

I expected to have lost a lot more weight by now, even if just water weight. I didn't have any keto flu symptoms either and even though its not necessary everyone gets it because they may not have mineral imbalance, having not had it makes me think I'm not in ketosis and not getting fat-adapted. Not sure what to do and any help would be appreciated.

Thanks a lot

Edit1: I guess I'm really asking for maybe these questions:

1) My concern is that I may just be losing weight due to CICO (my normal consumption pre keto was probably 2300 cals, so at 1500 cals, I'm getting a good caloric deficit). The problem is if my metabolism slows down before I'm fat adapted I'd have to further start restricting by a big amount. 

2) Should I get a way to measure if I'm in ketosis or not (breath analyzer or blood test machine).

3) Should I incorporate exercise (probably just walks for now and then running later) or should I wait for weight loss plateaus to incorporate them gradually?",t3_nur5ws

I've been back at it for several months now and the scale ain't moving. For the record, I'm 5'9, 33F CW 191 (SW205, GW150. Last year got down to 175). I eat up to 1600 calories a day taking into account that i walk 25-30miles a week. The 1600 includes about 100 extra calories for all the exercise so there still should be quite a good deficit.

While my legs/bum area have gotten a bit smaller and more toned, I‚Äôm not weight training (recovering from rotator cuff surgery so can‚Äôt just yet!) and thus not putting on loads of muscle so I can‚Äôt understand why the scale won‚Äôt budge!!! Between exercise and calorie restriction, I should be losing AT LEAST 1-2lb a week. I don‚Äôt weigh myself too often atm cos it makes me super depressed and today was the first day in weeks. 

I feel so defeated and depressed . All this hard work seems to be for nothing. I had a high carb day a couple weeks ago to try to break this plateau but obviously it didn‚Äôt help. I naturally have a slower crappy metabolism, ugh, so I‚Äôm wary of cutting my calories tooooooo  low as I‚Äôm not trying to slow it even further! Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated!!!",t3_nuf84m
421,I've lost 70lbs since February 2nd and it's the absolute best thing I've ever done for myself.,"This first photo is from December 20th, 2020 prior to starting keto and the second photo is from today, Jun 6th. I just completed 4 full months of strict keto on June 2nd. https://imgur.com/a/aN45CS6

I reached 260lbs at my heaviest and I knew I had to make a change. I noticed that after spending my life overweight, and seeing my father and other family members as well, it wasn't apparent how large I has become and how normalized it was for me and the people around me. It feels unbelievably good to think that I've lost 70lbs and I'm only 20lbs away from my goal. The goal is in sight, but there's a lifetime of healthier living ahead of me. Keto is life changing.",t3_ntuie4
422,An Attempt Without Mistakes,"Hello [r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/),

Long time keto enthusiast and have been on and off keto for the last 4 years. Lost 40 lbs in about 4 months the first time I did keto, however, later attempts had diminishing results. I believe this is due to my increased alcohol intake throughout college and my later part of high school. However, I plan on managing my alcohol intake much more in my next attempt at keto.

Whenever I'm on keto I stick to strict keto drinking guidelines, however, I think I have just been consuming too much, and taking too many calories in. I'm going to go on a sobriety cleanse for the next 2-3 weeks to not only lower my tolerance for future drinking but also give myself a boost for keto in general.

Not only that, I cheated occasionally which not only really messed up my diet but more importantly my motivation to keep on going. This was due to the properties of alcohol that make you want to eat carbs.

I think I'm the heaviest I've ever been, although I haven't scaled myself. I'm 21 years old, I think I'm somewhere between 220-230 lbs at 6'0"". I don't have a particular goal weight but I really need the motivation to not only get but keep on going.

Since it's the summer, I'm working, I'm on adderall (prescribed), I have a plan, working out again, I think I have a good thing going. I think posting this is more for myself and keeping up with my agenda more than it is for you guys. I would however really like some wishes before my keto journey again. I love this diet and I love this community.",t3_nuoldr

I'm back doing the same things I was the first time I was on Keto, but even better-I cut out alcohol this time, which I won't lie, was a LOT of calories even if they were Keto acceptable ones. Even if I wasn't on Keto, I should be seeing weight loss off the calorie deficit right there TBH. But no-I've been on Keto/no alcohol for two weeks, and the scale hasn't budged. My measurements have not budged. It's like I haven't changed a thing, which is frustrating the heck out of me.

I'm keeping under 15 net carbs/1200 calories a day, my ratios are good, I'm far more active than I have been since I can walk around without crutches and my walking cast again.

Got that out, then I couldn‚Äôt eat anything I liked without being on the toilet constantly. I tried everything.

434,Success and Failures (minor rant),"I started the keto diet in August 2020, in 5 months (or less) I lost over 65 pounds, and maintained, with only minor fluctuations. I took a break this year from February to May (2021) and gained 10 pounds back. 

In the past month ive lost the ten pounds I gained and stayed on the diet, but sometimes all I want is some chocolate that doesn't taste weird, bitter or chemical-ly, I want to eat sour patch kids and junk food that I would immediately regret. I miss grabbing a snack and not looking at the back to mentally calculate the amount of carbs it contains. 

This is one of the hardest things ive ever done. I miss candy, I miss chips (I know the quest ones exist but they're overpriced and im a broke college student). Today I spent a couple hours making this pizza recipe: [https://www.sweetashoney.co/keto-almond-flour-pizza-crust/](https://www.sweetashoney.co/keto-almond-flour-pizza-crust/) but it didn't turn out great and I was really disappointed (I saved all of my carbs to eat this pizza and some keto ice cream today).

With all of that being said I am staying on my diet, and im gonna make some bomb-ass popcorn. Ill suck it up and keep going, even on days where everything seems to fail and all you want is some goddamn pizza (and apparently all of the junk food in the world).

438,"4 months in, couldn't be happier","First- some back story
I've struggled with weight my whole life. After a diagnosis of active and aggressive Crohn's disease, my health went into a spiral.
Many surgeries, and other complications too numerous to list left me in sad shape. 
Extensive time recovering from procedures and wallowing in self pity exploded my weight and I was borderline diabetic.  I decided to seek the help from a nutritionist, but I learned that in my area, the only way one would see me is if I entered their bariatric surgery protocol. The medical profession left me hanging with two terrible options- surgery or nothing. 
Then some friends suggested trying a keto lifestyle.
After extensive research I decided to give it a try. I opted for a clean keto protocol, and also eliminated as much inflammatory foods possible, as well as utilizing herbs and spices with medicinal properties to enhance my efforts. 
It's been four months, and the results are nothing short of amazing. 
  The loss of 40 pounds would be satisfying enough, but the added results are equally if not moreso incredible.
My A1c is back into normal range, inflammation is way down, my heart rate, pulse ox and blood pressure are perfect.
I'm sleeping great, energy is way up and for the first time in a long time I actually feel good. 
  Since starting, I added intermittent fasting and am now moving toward OMAD.  The fasting was a challenge at first but now I manage to go all day without being ravenous.
Other things I've also included is drinking at least a gallon of water daily, and I avoid any of the piles of keto dessert or cheat recipes, opting instead for cooking with as few ingredients as possible. 
I'm having fun with this lifestyle, and am really happy I made the leap. 
&lt;Disclaimer&gt; the methods I'm using work great for me. Every person is different, and even moreso when you throw a disease like Crohn's into the mix. I'm very much still a novice in this, so in no way am I claiming expertise, I just wanted to share a glimpse of my journey.",t3_nu2ie9

441,120 lbs gone in almost a year,"Started July 16th 2020



Hey guys, Ive been mostly just sitting back taking in some of the advice you guys have had on this sub while on this journey for a year now. 

Im 21 currently, and at my SW I was 280. I would hide it fairly well so when I finally had the confidence to say thats what I used to weight, many people are shocked. I haven‚Äôt been under 200 lbs in over 7 years. 

Ive never known a life of having a stomach that is close to flat. My confidence has skyrocketed lately though, looking at myself in the mirror im getting to a point of acceptance. I never thought of myself as someone who would ever have the willpower to lose so much weight but ive been so strict with myself on this. Probably for the lack of control in my life, this was something I could control. I had the idea blasted in my head that I need to workout 60 mins a day, hard labor, sweating and making myself feel like shit to lose weight when thats not the reality.

The beginning of this diet definitely really was tough on me. I had no idea what I was supposed to eat since I was just starting out, I would eat just about the same thing every single day. Until I started opening myself up and looking into more meals and replacement foods I found that this diet isn‚Äôt as restrictive as I once thought. I replaced cookies with quest cookies, chips with quest chips, brownie cups to chicken Parm to even quest pizzas.


I can still somewhat eat things that I would be able to eat before. I found that some of the people in my life trying to do this diet don‚Äôt realize that there is a lot of replacements for the things you crave and I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve made it throughout this diet if I didn‚Äôt have some of those things.

Personally the keto diet kind of feels like a game every day. How am I gonna use this amount of points (20 carbs per day) to make myself full.

Im happy to say that my CW is 165 losing over 120lbs in (almost) a year. Although my loss was definitely helped by the effects of my testosterone as I am ftm I did little to no working out really. I dont think I ever would have lost this weight if I never found this diet or sub so thank you all to the helpful advice ive seen along the way (:",t3_ntu575

445,Supplements Causing My Weight Loss To Stall?,"Hey all! After a two week binge I am now 3 weeks into full ketosis. Normally at this point I am losing a pound a day until I hit my plateau weight of 210lbs. I am 45/M/6'1""/224, lift heavy 3 times a week, and cardio on the off days. I have done this pattern probably 30 times in my 5 years of 3 months on 2 week binge, so I know the process pretty well. So I have been stuck at 224 for about two weeks now, and I added a bunch of new supplements and was curious if you guys have had any issues with any of the below supplements causing you to stall, or if they have hidden carbs. I know that weight isn't the best indicator, as muscle gain could affect this, also my pants have been fitting looser, but I should be down to around 215 at this point. I also called Life Extension to check if their products had any hidden carbs, but they said no. Let me know what you think, or anyone has experienced the same thing, I take the recommended dosages or lower. Thank you!

448,35 &gt; 30,"Today is my 35th birthday, and the 4th birthday I‚Äôve celebrated since I started keto back in November 2017.

I come from a family where the women lament every birthday because they hate getting older, it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever known. My mother started crying on her 40th birthday when the mariachi band at the Mexican restaurant we were eating at came to our table and started playing/singing Happy Birthday. Big ol‚Äô crocodile tears, y‚Äôall! I was 16 years old at the time and was already thinking that I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to getting older just watching my own mother‚Äôs misery. 

I went through this phenomenon myself in my 20s. I got married to my best friend at 22, graduated college that same year, and had my daughter at 23. By that point I had gone from 135lbs to 215lbs, blamed it on the stress of being an adult/wife/mother, just couldn‚Äôt lose the baby weight, ‚Äúmy metabolism is broken,‚Äù and every other excuse I could think of. I blamed everything except the myself, and really‚Ä¶I was the only reason I was obese and unhealthy. Me. 

I was unhappy with my life because of this and found myself more and more miserable with each passing birthday. I was dreading my 30s the faster they approached. I held it together in front of my family when 30 and 31 hit but I was in an almost-panicked state internally. I took a drive alone after my 31st birthday brunch and weeped openly while scarfing down half a dozen donuts from my favorite donut place. The world was so unfair!


Five months later it was Halloween and per tradition my husband and I took our 7-year old daughter trick-or-treating. As usual I started getting winded after the first three houses and my child was old enough to notice it that year. When we got back home, she asked me if I was going to die sooner than my husband was. She‚Äôs a smart and very perceptive kid, and I realized in that moment that I couldn‚Äôt definitively tell her ‚Äúno‚Äù because‚Ä¶she was right. I might die sooner than I‚Äôm supposed to because of choices I made every day. Later I learned that she‚Äôd overheard two teachers at her school discussing obesity and heart disease (one of them had recently lost her very obese father) and this is what brought on the concern for her mother‚Äôs health. My health. 

I started taking responsibility for my physical state the very next day; having direct proof that my lack self control, irresponsible food choices, and binging episodes were affecting my family was too much to bear. I think I always knew deep down, but I had become a master at lying to myself so I could binge eat whatever I wanted without guilt. Hitting rock bottom isn‚Äôt fun, but it‚Äôs often a necessary evil that opens the door to much better things. 

I decided I was done with being a miserable person and after some research on what diets were left to try that I hadn‚Äôt already failed at, I started keto the next day, hoping it would actually be the change that took permanently because so many other diets I‚Äôd tried over the years simply‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt. 


By the time June 2018 rolled around, not only was I having zero issues sticking to keto, I‚Äôd also gone from 215lbs down to 155‚Ä¶60lbs in 5 months. I still had 20lbs left before hitting my goal weight, but hot damn did I feel great! I also had a ton of health issues clear up that I previously thought were just things I would have to deal with as I got older: high cholesterol/BP, insomnia, chronic reflux, panic attacks, muscle pains, blah blah blah. Everything got better. 

I woke up on my 32nd birthday feeling HAPPY. I was no longer lamenting my 30s, not dreading getting older, actually *excited* to celebrate in a way that was genuine! I was a better person because of my decision to change my eating habits‚Ä¶who knew something so simple could change a person‚Äôs deep-seated hatred of birthdays, a hatred that was passed down through generations of female family members?

I woke up today a healthy and happy 35 year old woman, probably the first in my family to be excited about the mid-30s and looking forward to the 40s out there on the horizon. I‚Äôm having the [keto cheesecake brownies](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/brownie-cheesecake-low-carb-and-gluten-free/)  I‚Äôve made for myself every year and enjoying time with my family as everyone should when celebrating another year of life! 

30 sucked because I was making choices that made me miserable. 35 kicks ass because I make the right choices every day. Thus, 35 is greater than 30. 

I wish for all of you to feel the same way I do about getting older. ü§òüèª It‚Äôs inevitable anyway, we may as well enjoy each year more than the last!",t3_ntmfcr

Plenty of healthy greens and eggs each morning.  Everyone talks bad on keto saying ‚Äúas soon as you stop keto you gain all the weight back‚Äù NO SHIT FATTY! You went back to eating a tub of ice cream and pasta for 3 days a week, what did you expect. If you do keto and then once you are finished you just eat overall more healthy you can easily maintain a healthy physique.

453,I am SO upset.,"Ive just started keto. I'm 8 days in. I made the STUPIDEST mistake. I am a serious starbucks addict. So instead of my super sugary drinks I have switched to a shaken espresso with heavy cream. I was surprised how delicious it was. 
Well i got one today and it wasn't shaken. To my HORROR i realized that almost the entire cup was heavy cream. It didnt even occur to me that it would be ALL cream. 
Heavy cream is 800 calories per cup. AND ive been cooking with it as well. 
What a terrible end to my first week. üòû

I know this is a learning experience but damn I'm dissapointed in how much ive consumed this week. Makes me nauseous to think about.

455,Hard to get enough calories,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this after I used to be starving on 2,000 cal a day but I find it rly hard to get to maintenance calories. I am on a plan that has me fasting every other day, and on my eating days I rly have no appetite but I have to eat anyway. Without carbs, I find it rly hard to eat to my maintenance calories of 2,300. Just so I‚Äôm clear, It‚Äôs an adf plan but on my eating days I eat to maintenance to help preserve metabolism. Keto and fasting has just made my appetite non existant lol but it‚Äôs imprortant that I stick to this plan. Also, it‚Äôs important that I stay keto during this process, I don‚Äôt want to eat carbs. They are addictive and I find that they actually make hungrier. Also , if I eat carbs and then fast I am hungry on my fasting day.",t3_nu52kx

I am already a pretty skinny guy and I am actually a bit concerned about losing more weight by doing Keto. So I am trying to get into Keto/remain in Keto for the mental clarity, while also maintaining or even gaining a bit of weight. With all that being said, is it worth buying a keto-mojo metre so I can see how how much of what foods I can eat without it pushing me out of ketosis. I understand that if I ‚Äústay below 20g‚Äù of net carbs I‚Äôll be fine, but I‚Äôve heard this keto threshold varies between 20-50g for some individuals. And I personally need to eat as much food as possible to gain, let alone maintain weight.

Low carb stabilises my blood sugar and the protein and fat keeps me really full. These two things have made it really easy to reduce my calorie intake and also find bags more energy. I‚Äôve kept carbs down to around 20g per day, just what is in the veg I eat. I can feel general inflammation has reduced and every day I notice little improvements. Very excited about the potential and I can‚Äôt find a logical reason not to keep up the good work.

But for some reason, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna crack. I feel like I‚Äôm going to eat some carbs or some chocolate.


My questions are:

Do you find you get these moments while on keto? 

Are they worse as a beginner? Is this just a three week hump?

If you feel these cravings, what techniques do you employ to avoid sugar/carbs and stay in ketosis?",t3_ntwdyt
462,Happy Belated 2 Year Ketoversary,"The beginning of May marked 2 years on keto for me, and I haven‚Äôt looked back. Though I will say, it has gotten more complicated as far as food intolerances go and playing around with macros.

These days, my girlfriend and I eat mostly meat but we are not super strict about that. I have an array of keto-approved snack foods in the pantry (anyone else love Catalina Crunch?), and I don‚Äôt know that I could ever stop eating peanut butter ü§§ü§§ü§§ but for the most part I would say my eating is very clean. 

Keto in my family was like an infectious disease. My brother was the pioneer of this WOE, and my father and I soon followed his lead. I convinced my girlfriend to hop on board with me (mostly because I was horrified that she used the 1/4 cup measure as a sugar scooper for her morning coffee) and even my mom has joined us. We were all leading unhealthy lifestyles and now we are all healing because of keto. 

Sometimes I feel like a member of a cult. I try to keep my thoughts on others‚Äô diets to myself, but sometimes it‚Äôs so difficult. When a coworker complains to me about their struggles with weight loss and tell me they switched to ‚Äúwhole wheat pasta‚Äù and ‚Äúeating fat free yogurt‚Äù I have to bite my tongue. I show off my progress pictures to those people but to them, such a large amount of weight lost would be impossible. 

Between the two of us, my girlfriend and I have lost over 200 lbs. I alone lost over 120. I took 11 inches off my waist and went from a jean size 24 to a Jean size 10-12 (depending on brand). I used to purchase XXL shirts, now I wear a Medium. For a long time, I still saw the fat girl in the mirror. I still struggle even now with seeing pictures of myself and thinking ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt be me.‚Äù The excess skin is my biggest issue these days. It saddens me that I‚Äôm so ashamed still of the body I worked so hard for. But I think it‚Äôs finally starting to go away. 

If you‚Äôre someone reading this who is considering trying out this WOE as another desperate attempt at shedding those pounds, I‚Äôm telling you to do it. It changed my life, for the better. Even with the loose skin, even with the feeling like I‚Äôm part of a cult, even with the limitations and drawbacks of social gatherings, I figure it the fuck out. Because I don‚Äôt want to be unhealthy ever again.

472,NSV - Fat Adapted,"I have been on keto now for about five or six weeks, and I am feeling good.  My family went out to dinner tonight to Red Robin.  I didn't eat anything until dinner, not because I tried to fast, but because I didn't get hungry until right before.  I think I am becoming fat adapted.  It is really quite exciting.  Instead of bottomless fries, I had bottomless salad without croutons.  I left the restaurant full, but not in pain.

My wife and I are doing this together, and we are moving our house to all low-carb food, including moving our pre-teen daughter off of high carb foods (she is mostily on board with this).  We cleaned out our pantry today of most of our high-carb food.  

I just wanted to share how this new (but really, really old) way of eating is changing my life.  I am down 11 lbs (still have about 110 more to go), but I am not hungry like I used to be on other diets.  I eat high protien, high fat food when I am hungry, and I am still losing!

473,Insomnia is ruining it for me,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing this because i litteraly tired of the situation i'm facing which i'm pretty sure is related to keto.

I started in january and have lost 40+ pounds since.

I did have insomnia but i completed with magnesium and sodium and didn't have a real problem after the first 2 weeks.

It did feel great, i felt really good and focused. More clear headed and energetic.
Also so much less depressed.

Life is not that great atm and blah blah blah long story short i ended up cheating at the beginning of may.

I've been trying to get back to it and I have .
Several times.
The problem i have is staying on it.

Not because i crave carbs,
 but because i can't fking sleep. 


Magnesium and electrolytes don't seem to do the trick anymore.
I take 1g of magnesium (bisglycinate) each day.
And some melatonin/mg pills before bed.

I go to bed exhausted, sleep something like 1-3 hours max and wake up, really rested at first but about 6 hours tops after i wake up, my brain shuts off.

I work from home so it's not a problem but i'm supposed to be working now and i just can't.

I'm in a serious brain fog and i can't concentrate.
I feel 'wired' but completely exhausted so i just go back to bed but just end up wasting time as i cant fall asleep and have this 'anxious/restless feeling, my eyes are heavy and dry.


When i cheat it stops, so i do it again.
And of course it's an excuse, but i'm hoing through it again and i can't take this anymore, i don't understand what's going on.


Is it really keto?
I usually don't go over 12-13g carbs a day (usually broccoli or zucchini), should i get more?

Am i eating too much protein ?(im at 131 g and 90 fat)

I fast too but lately i keep breaking it because when i'm tired i get hungry.
Actually hungry.

I also drink coffee, like 1 full pot every morning, could this be it?

I don't know where to turn as i keep seeing that i should increase the Mg intake but it doesn't work anymore

Any ideas?
I've been doing so good i don't want to stop but i think i'm gonna have to, it's driving me nuts.",t3_ntgdub
474,Where can I find both keto AND low fiber recipes?,"So after months and months of experimentation, I‚Äôve found that not only my digestion gets totally screwed by many types of carbs, but also by fiber.

I actually have to be even more strict with fiber than with net carbs ‚Äî as long as I avoid totally fructose/lactose/starch. I do not need to go totally zero carb though.

Now with all those restrictions I have to be kinda creative to find recipes that I actually can cook.

483,Keto and low oxalite,"Hi

I suffer from  Lichen sclerosus and for about 6 weeks I have been following a keto / dairy free diet in a hope to sort out my issues, I feel a lot better in myself (less tired) for the diet, but it has not really been helping with the symptoms I am suffering from. Upon looking into things apparently oxalites can also be a trigger for the disease and I had been having a lot of high oxalite foods whilst following the keto diet (nuts/almond milk/almond butter/raspberries/coco/dark chocolate ect) I am only having 2 meals a day now as i dont feel as hungry as i did before keto.

So i have also cut oxalites and eggs out of my diet, once the condition has cleared up I plan on adding things back into my diet to see what the is causing my flare ups.

My meals are fairly bland I was wondering if you knew of any keto friendly, none dairy/egg, low oxalite foods, as all im eating at the moment is.

Meats /fish

healthy oils

mushrooms, green peppers, avacado, broccoli, lettuce

coffee/ warm lemon with coconut oil drink, water

garlic, salt, white pepper

I would really like to find something I could have as a snack to replace the nuts /raspberries I was having before as its a pain to cook a pan of bacon if I just want something to eat before bed. Also my meals are a bit boring as most spices are high in oxalites.

Also I am supplementing vitamin D, fish oil, magnesium,calcium and im using low salt and himalayan salt on my meals for my sodium and potassium, are there any minerals i am missing?

Thanks",t3_ntl377

488,How to adjust my macros due to increased activity? My (success) story included.,"Hey there, I‚Äôm going to start out with a little of my ‚Äústory‚Äù. I‚Äôve always been a bigger guy, but I‚Äôve been turning that around over the last few years. At my biggest I was around 330lbs(5‚Äô10, 37yrs now). 

Like many of you, I had my wake up call, I needed change in my life, I was too young to stay on that path and I know as the years tick by, the weight takes a greater toll on the body, plus it‚Äôs harder to get in shape. I did some research and Keto was what I decided to try.

That was late June, 2016. I cut sugar totally, cut carbs, but I was doing what I describe as lazy keto, no food scales or apps, just cut the crap out of my diet. By October that same year I had dropped to 250lbs. An absolute game changer.

I faded away from the keto diet and returned back to my old ways, but I was out of the 300 club and I never wanted to return. My weight fluctuates between 270-280 for a couple years.

Last year I had a bad leg injury, had to wear a leg brace and couldn‚Äôt walk much if at all for 8 weeks. This was during Covid, but prior to the injury I was really getting into hiking, i had found the perfect activity for me. Then the injury.

At that point I was at 270lbs, and I knew, one of 2 things would happen, I‚Äôd pack on the weight feeling bad for myself, being totally sedentary. The other option is I take the challenge and try and get healthier. I gave myself 1 week of soul food and junk, then I fully committed to Keto.

That‚Äôs when I found this sub, and learned the techniques. I bought a food scale, downloaded the Carb Manager app and started the journey. Instead of putting on weight, I dropped it. I went from 270lbs to 228lbs by October. It was incredible. 

Let me tell you, anyone who is reading this, keto changed my life. The compliments from friends, especially people I haven‚Äôt seen in a while, was such a motivator. For the first time in maybe 15 years, I was able to wear XL shirts, which was a game changer because now I could wear what I want, not what fits.

But winter came, I had to return to full duty at work and with the schedule and everything, not to mention other events in life, I went off keto. Since, I‚Äôve put weight back on, I‚Äôm 250lbs now. I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to go back in strict keto, right now I‚Äôm at day 5, keeping within my macros, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good, but I think I need to adjust my macros due to increased activity.

My current macros, based on sedentary lifestyle, is 125g protein, 135g fat, 1816cal, and 20g carbs or less. These macros were great for last year, but I work outdoors and my job is fairly physical, plus I‚Äôm enjoying hiking again. 

My question is how do I adjust based on my increased activity? Should I get a fitbit(or fitness tracker) to keep track of calories burned, and add those to my calorie total? If anyone has tips or suggestions please help!",t3_nta1vg

497,Keto‚Äôs kicking my ass,"Hey guys!

6‚Äô2 male, 96.8 kgs/213.4 lbs

This is my 3rd day on a keto diet and it is a very hard diet to maintain as I have come to realize that I am very dependent on carbs. 

I am about 6-7 kgs overweight, and I wanted to drop that weight in less than two months, so I took up a keto diet as my stepmom has been doing it for 2 years and she has seen some crazy results.

The problem is, I am quite conflicted and would like some advice. The weight that I want to lose is pretty small, and all I really want to do is lose the fat in my butt and my hips. 

At first, I wanted to do a normal diet where I eat at about a 700-800 calorie deficit but still eat whatever I want, but I decided to do a keto diet and keep my carb consumption below 50g. 

Would you think I would be ok doing a regular diet and keep my calorie deficit pretty big (around 30%), or should I suck it up and keep doing keto? I know it has a lot of health benefits too, but I am experiencing ‚Äúketo flu‚Äù atm.

Thank you!

Edit: Thank you all for the helpful advice! I decided to stick to my keto program and keep better track of my macros and electrolytes as I was doing a bad job at that while also maintaining a reasonable calorie deficit.",t3_nt04j4

I'm hoping someone can give me insight as to where I might be able to remedy this, it was bad in the first two weeks but I just put that down to a transition period but the fact that it's still hapenning 7 weeks in is annoying and I'm wondering whether this is good for me.",t3_nt4x52

508,15 pounds of sugar vs. 152 pounds of sugar,"I just read an article that said the average person eats 152 pounds of sugar a year. That is over 3 pounds per week! Now, if someone on a strict KETO WOE ate their 20 grams of carbs as sugar--they still would only be consuming one pound of sugar every 22 days as there are 453.59 grams of sugar in a pound. So divide that by 20 grams (one day's worth of carbs on a strict keto diet) you get 22.68 days to eat one pound of sugar. Even if you upped your intake to 50 grams, you would still only be eating 30 pounds of sugar in a year. Those extra sugar carbs ""normal"" people are eating are basically empty calories with no nutritional value as our body can produce the glucose it needs. No wonder we have an obesity epidemic. 

Just think of ALL the extra nutrition those on a ketogenic world of eating are getting--all the extra essential fatty acids, amino acids, and vitamins by replacing 100 pounds or more of empty calories with nutritious ones OR just cutting down on empty calories that would be converted to the adipose fat on our bodies.",t3_nskkqk

511,My First 2 Months,"Me: I'm something like 2 months in (I honestly don't remember): M-5'9""; SW:220lbs; GW:180; CW:205. Target Cals: 1800. 20g of carbs.    
Things I've learned in the first two months:

1. Month one: Ramp your carbs down, it's easier. Pedialyte or other electrolyte powder helps that first week or so
2. Booze really makes weight loss harder.
3. Stalls are real, you have to fight them with strictness and patience.  Review your calories, be detail oriented, and drink water. Then drink more water.
4. That magic ""My hunger has disappeared!"" goes away after a while.  It's still the best ""diet"" I've ever seen.
5. I've been conditioning myself to ""eat like a fat person"" WAY longer than I have ""eat like a \[goal weight\] person"".
6. Holy cow inflammation really gets better!
7. When you are hungry: eat a meal. Don't snack your day away.  By meal I mean something that fits your days intake, like a salad.
8. I forgot what eight was for...
9. The desire to 'cheat' diminishes over time. Make it worth it.  Pick fried chicken! Be aware of your self destructive tendencies.  This is why are here.
10. Don't fall for the ""I'm not hungry!"" trap.  You need to eat to be nice to your loved ones, and have energy. Keep eating.
11. Don't fall for ""keto recipes!"" (if you are being strict with carbs) -- those are great for when you are ""low"" carb, but the hard truth is: you don't get bread and sweets and pasta and stuff like that (during your 'badass' phase). 
12. Ok, I bought the monk fruit sweetener. It has more carbs than I'm allowing myself (see #10)  I'll use it when I get into ""maintenance mode"".
13. My wife thinks I'm nicer.
14. Write down your food BEFORE you eat it. OMG I can't stress this on enough. It keeps you from making dumb decisions and blowing your count for the day.  ""Oh no, half an avocado has 6 grams of carbs! I'll adjust it, not regret it"", you dig?
15. Recording your food is about being honest with yourself about what you eat.

513,New to LC and not losing - need advice,"Long post - sorry! Wanted to make sure the details were covered. 

My husband is 5‚Äô9‚Äù, 230, in a sedentary job, and needs to lose about 70 pounds and dramatically lower his cholesterol/improve LDL and HDL, as he can‚Äôt take statin drugs anymore due to side effects. I lost most of the weight I wanted to on a low-calorie diet but am also eating LC now with him for support. 

He‚Äôs pre-diabetic and on Metformin with an A1c of 5.9 which has been at 6.1 occasionally. Numbers are better on LC, and he has cut the Metformin dose in half to avoid lows. Goal is to get down to normal range. He also has sleep apnea which we are hoping will be improved with weight loss, as CPAP is a struggle. 

We‚Äôve been eating 20-25 net carbs (usually under 20) since April 23. He has only lost 8 pounds, and most of that was in the first couple of weeks and now goes up and down with the same few pounds since that time. He‚Äôs not cheating. 

For simplicity and hopefully to jumpstart his losses he‚Äôs been eating the same meals and amounts as I am but with an extra LC snack or two a day. His calories are still probably under his recommended deficit. At 30% he‚Äôs calculated around 1550. I‚Äôd say he eats between 1300-1400. 

We don‚Äôt eat malitol at all. Meals use the Costco keto bread 1-2 times a week and an Aldi keto bun maybe 1 time a week. No Atkins bars or similar at all. I use the Keto and Co pancake mix 1 time a week when I have it. Desserts are usually keto cheesecake (nut crust, sweetened with Swerve only) or a Keto salted caramel ice cream bar from Costco. He was using Toriani coffee syrups that I saw had sucralose, but I‚Äôm ordering different ones without it ‚Äî just waiting on them to arrive. 

Now that I‚Äôve run his macros I know he‚Äôs under on protein by about 20-25g a day, so I‚Äôll be working on that. He drinks a lot of water (about 120oz min) most days. 

Any ideas as to what is causing the very slow loss? Can calories be too low on keto? He has a lot to lose, so I‚Äôd think it would be coming off a lot faster than it is. I‚Äôm sure his doctor will be expecting decent results off the cholesterol meds at his next visit in August.",t3_nsumba

I think that this is very common and happen to the most people but they never recognize it because it is normal for them.

So I (M, 32, 6ft) started keto at the New Year, the one resolution in my life I was determined to keep. I've been keto nonstop since then, with no cheat days. Started at 315 and am down to 258. My goal weight is 175, my weight when I graduated HS. My last two months I averaged 1.75 pounds lost per week. I'm aiming for at least 2, so I've started IF/OMAD to try to get closer to my weekly goal.  

I'm burned the fuck out though. I've lost sight of why I'm doing this in the first place, really. At this point its just routine, a habit.

Fuck if I know.  

I should honestly be happy right now, given my progress and where I'm at in my life, but I'm not. I need some outsiders perspective maybe. I dunno. Is there anyone out there who's been in a similar position? What did you do to give yourself the kick in the ass to keep going?",t3_nsh7gz

523,How to eat enough fat without dairy,"Hi,

I am attempting keto as someone who is allergic to dairy and I'm finding it very difficult to eat enough fat. Most of the advice for getting fat consumption above 70% involves putting butter, ghee, cream, cheese in everything. I enjoy most non-dairy fats such as olives, olive oils, eggs, fatty fish, nuts, bacon, avocados, etc. But even if I eat this all the time, I don't see how it's possible to get above 70% consistently, unless I am downing olive oil throughout the day. I have no problems with limiting carbs, but I eat a fair amount of meat to fill me up (not copious though).

Is Keto not really suitable for someone who can't eat dairy? What can I do about my fat/protein ratios?

***Calculating fat content in foods***

Another question I have is how do I find out the number of calories of fat in food items? I understand that the 70% is for *calories* of fat rather than *weight* (in grams). Most nutritional websites only list the weight of fat, protein, carbs, so how do I find out the calories of fat?

Are there any resources/references with this information?

Thanks in advance.",t3_nsn9a7
524,Keto Again?,"Five years ago I found myself heavier and more out of shape than I ever expected to end up.  I had been intensely focused on work and somehow went from my normal 75-80kg to nearly 110.

After I lost that weight, I went to a carb restricted but not dedicated diet.  That worked for a few years as the carbs quietly and stealthily reentered my lifestyle choices.  Recently I've found the idea, and taste, of pasta coated in a gorgeous tomato sauce with a side of fried potato as a good idea.

So... Here I am five years after the dedication and it's become apparent I'm about to be on the same path I went down before.  My weight is up, lethargy is up, and my belly is winning the race at the moment.

i ended up adding too much flour in an effort to save or ""fix"" it and make it less sticky. it's currently baking right now, but im not even sure it'll come out right. the amount of dough this recipe made resulted in only a small ball of dough. so the more flour i added, the ""fuller"" the dough ball got before i tried numerous times to roll it out without it breaking.

any advice or proper recipe websites would be appreciated!",t3_nsgzzv

540,Am I doing it right?,"Hello! First post here! 

If anyone has any advice for what I'm eating I'd appreciate the help! I started early to mid-may and since then I've lost about 13lbs at least at the highest weight that  I was. I believe I've hit a plateau but I don't want to seem desperate. Thankfully, since starting I don't really get sugary cravings of food I used to eat before so that has been the best feeling ever. I feel like this would be something I can do basically forever, I just want to do it right, to be healthier and start a workout routine where I end up physically fit since I want to start more outdoor activities like running, kayaking, rock climbing and maybe even try bow hunting, 'cause hy not. Anywho, here goes:

\-Breakfast: 2 Eggs and a slice of bacon w/ sharp cheddar cheese. Then coffee w/ little whole milk, 2 Equal and 1 Stevia (idk why, it's the best tasting combination I've found for myself)

\-Lunch: 2 Chicken thighs w/ skin on &amp; a cup of broccoli (w/ garlic butter, 1tbs) w/ freshly made guac (usually half a Hass avocado &amp; tomatoes, sometimes by itself)

\-Dinner: Essentially  just 1/4 lb burger meat with more sharp cheddar

I always eat macadamia nuts between lunch and dinner, a fat bomb here and there. I'm wanting to do salmon at least once a week, doing it for dinner would seem like the best choice. I've made the math and this is about 1800 cal w/ \~130g of fat &amp; 19ish carbs, at least I hope. I drink lots and lots of water. I truly don't know if I'm doing enough or if the protein is too high if that's even a thing. I don't mind the monotony one bit, so that doesn't seem to be the issue, I just want to know I'm doing enough as I feel I could be doing better. If it matters I'm a guy, late 20s, \~188lb.

Usually, just upping my movement and being more careful about what I eat is enough to get me back on track, but not this time.

After seeing a friend literally lose more than half her body weight doing keto over the same period I gained 10-15 lbs, I decided to give it a go.  My plan was to just do it for the month before I leave for vacation, but I find that over all, I like the way I feel, I‚Äôm not getting bloated at all like I used to, and I like that I am losing weight.

My issue is that my diet is now rather strict.

It‚Äôs hard enough to eat vegetarian sometimes (as in, hard to find vegetarian food) but doing both seems like it will be next to impossible on my trip.  And honestly, I don‚Äôt know know that I want to be this carb restricted long term, even when I get home.

553,Anyone else find it hard to gain the weight back?,"I started Keto around January / February of this year and relatively easily lost 25 lbs which put me at my lowest adult weight and moved me from the overweight to normal weight range.

About a month ago I went off keto due to some vacation and traveling, and I assumed that I would start putting the weight back on. To my surprise, in a month of being off keto, I gained maybe 2-3 lbs. Now, I didn't completely go back to my old diet, but that was not because I was being health conscious. It was more that I didn't have the craving to drink that soda. It wasn't appealing to me like it used to be.

When I think back, I realize that I gained the weight over the course of 10+ years, so it makes sense that maybe I put on weight very slowly. I feel like what keto has brought to my life is that I can lose weight much easier than I gain it back which is like a dream to me.

565,Dialing in net carbs,"Hi,

I have a couple of questions regarding net carbs.

1) I usually stick to 20g net carbs or less, but due to accident or experimentation, I've discovered that my limit may be 40g--or even higher. 

I am not athletic, but I've always done primal blueprint/low carb and would usually have a BPC for breakfast, a big salad for lunch, and then protein, veggie and sweet potato or rice for dinner, with maybe some snacks in between. I was overeating on kcals of course, but many times I would wake up with really smelly pee and bad breath--which now I know are ketones. 

That said, is there any benefit between 20g net carbs to 40g net carbs in terms of weight loss, with other macros being equal? Sometimes if I eat berries with dinner I'll be in a deeper state of ketosis the next morning, both via blood tests and how I feel.

2) Let's say my threshold is Xg net carbs, and Xg + 1g will truly halt ketosis. Is there a difference in returning to ketosis between Xg + 1g and Xg + 50g? It would seem that less glycogen is stored when you only go over a little bit, and therefore will be depleted more quickly. Am I off on that?

At a check up on 3/8 I weight 257lbs and they said I can get back on keto, so I did - with a vengeance. At this morning's checkup I weighed in at 217lbs.

My doc is super happy about it, and so am I. She fist-bumped me and congratulated me on the weight loss. Asked me what my goal was and I told her 200, she said that's a great weight for my age and height. 

It's so crazy! I've done literally no exercise other than rehab on my hips and have lost this much. The dog food bags for my dogs weigh about 35lbs each. I've been carrying all that additional weight, it's shocking once you pick it up like that.

568,[SV] 50 lbs down!,"As someone who grew up in the metric system, I have to admit the old Lbs measurement sure is a better way for weight loss. There is more goals involved. :)

I started April 17th 2021 after my Ex broke up with me 4 days prior (Also Apr 17th last time I had contact). Granted I was always overweight during the relationship and pretty much stable at that weight rarely climbing but also not losing. They didn't break up with me because of it (At least they said it wasn't an issue), however it did play on my mental game. Very insecure, no confidence, very shy and introverted. Should have done this when we got together 3 years ago. But I decided I'm 32, I have to make a change now or never.

April 17th Weight: 193.3 KG (426.15 lbs)

June 3rd Weight: 170.6 KG (376.10 lbs)

Day Count: 47. 

See! in Metric it doesn't seem as impressive to say I lose 22.7kg. And I've been keeping track of both KG and the lbs totals because its just a nice way to keep pushing on.

Keto sure does give you that mental clarity and edge compared to the other diets around.

I‚Äôm trying to eat more vegetables now like this morning I had a plain salad with oil and vinegar dressing and not even an hour later I‚Äôm having severe cramping and diarrhea.

I‚Äôve been keto for 5 years now, off and on. But my main foods were ground beef, eggs, bratwursts, etc...

I can no longer eat red meat. Anything beef smells like it‚Äôs decomposing and rotten and makes me gag. I tried so hard but it is only getting worse. I already don‚Äôt eat pork, I can no longer eat eggs or egg whites (this is devastating it was my staple), turkey in any form is very iffy. It‚Äôs not great but edible. Yogurt smells weird but I can stomach it for the most part. I just am so sick of chicken because that seems to be the one that I can do. 

I don‚Äôt know what to buy anymore. I‚Äôm always trying to keep it on a tight budget and I can‚Äôt just eat seafood it‚Äôs really expensive here. I‚Äôm frustrated and frankly keep falling off the wagon because carbs are all alright and taste good.

575,Artificial sweeteners keto (weight gain/ no fat loss),"Hey guys,

I need support for my question. So I've been doing keto since 3 years with success, but now  I have a plateau at about 16% BF.

Well, I'm doing IF and eat less than 5% carbs and I count calories. But I'm drinking lots of diet soda and sweet everything I bake or prepare with sweeteners like saccharin.

Now I read that this may could be the problem. I'm drinking diet soda while fasting and I understand that those sweeteners may prevent fat loss.

What's your opinion about that?

And, if I cut out every sweeteners in my fasting window, so just water or black coffee, but take a little bit of sweeteners in my eating window, would that be ok??

I'm American but I'm currently in Spain for a few weeks and since I don't like syevia and monk fruit isn't available here at all, I only got those options.

I started on April 1 at 206 pounds. Have reduced to 173 pounds on June 1 on a keto OMAD diet. Low 170s was kind of my target, as I am no longer a young man, and if my weight falls much below 170 pounds, I begin to look like a gaunt and wizened Gandalf-type character telling the world ""Thou shalt not PASS!"".

Anyway, my plan for month three is to eat maintenance calories with high protein, and stay in the 170 range, and hopefully build some muscle.

579,Well I'm over the 50% mark today. Sorta a success story.,Today I weighed in at 271lbs which means in I'm down 54lbs from my starting weight of 325. My goal is to get to 225 or below. It took a long time to hit this. Almost a year coming up actually. On top of losing weight I was also able to quit vaping which is nice. I've had a lot of up's and down's since I started but right now I feel pretty good I'm starting to think I might have a career as a day trader so that's pretty cool too. Looking back I think the two biggest reasons I fell out of keto was due to emotional eating and losing motivation. Right now though I'm pretty happy knowing I have less than 50 lbs left before I hit my goal weight. Also if any of you wanna ask me questions go ahead.,t3_nr17yk

I get about a month in and  I start getting obsessive over my food to the point of not even wanting to eat. It's like I just panic. I won't eat anything for 2 or 3 days then I end up binging to compensate and fall into a depression because I failed again only to repeat the cycle a few months later. 

I know so many people have had great success with keto. I just haven't. I don't know if it's something I'm doing wrong or if maybe this just isn't for me. Has anyone else struggled with anything like this?

584,5 lbs in 4 days!?!,"I don‚Äôt get it. I have never been able to lose weight really. I‚Äôve tried a variety of things including just straight up calorie restriction. (Not a fan of those types of diets - Noom tries to sell that as something revolutionary. It‚Äôs not.) They have literally never worked for me. 

I last tried 2 weeks of tracking and pretty severe calorie deficits with almost nothing lost. I had almost given up trying. My weight isn‚Äôt too high - 173 for 5‚Äô8‚Äù male - so I thought I‚Äôd live with it. 

Last week, we got one of those smart scales and it said my visceral fat was in the high range. (Put aside the inaccuracy criticisms. This is not the place for them.) That was the kick in the pants I needed. I don‚Äôt care too much about the aesthetics side of weight. But the health concerns associated with too much visceral fat, that‚Äôs a different story. 

So, I started keto on Monday. I‚Äôm not restricting calories (much). Just focusing on my carbs and trying my best to hit my fat target. Drinking plenty of water. 

I‚Äôm down from 173 on Monday morning to 168 this morning. I know people say it‚Äôs just water weight being lost but my water percentage, at least according to my scale, has gone from 505.% to 51.3%. I know smart scales aren‚Äôt considered to be too accurate but I figure it‚Äôs got to be at least internally consistent, right? (They are. See my edit and source linked.) If so, it‚Äôs not water either. 

My body fat has dropped a full point too. 

So, what gives? I don‚Äôt get it. I am at a tiny ~200kcal deficit but that doesn‚Äôt translate into 5 whole pounds in 4 days!

Anyway, it‚Äôs been a mostly smooth week with the keto. I want to get to 160 and we‚Äôll see what happens after that.

Edit: because it seems there‚Äôs conventional wisdom that smart scales aren‚Äôt good measures for body composition, i thought I‚Äôd look and see what actual research says. 

&gt;	While the Fitbit AriaTM smart scale may not be valid for all individuals (as compared to ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù lab methods), it is a reliable at-home method for measuring body composition from day- to-day and week-to-week.

I should note that I am working with an endocrinologist on elevated prolactin levels and also taken Cabergoline.

I‚Äôm a fairly new redditor. I‚Äôve been doing the Keto diet for about 5-6 months and have lost approximately 25 lbs and lots of inches on my waist. I didn‚Äôt have a TON of body fat to lose to begin with and am doing it more to support my girlfriend on her weight loss journey. 

I just had my annual bloodwork, and everything was normal and healthy except for my cholesterol which came back totally trashed. Very low HDL (35), and high total cholesterol at 449. Triglycerides were super high too (185). 

Last time I did keto a few years ago I quit it for the same reason, and since then my cholesterol has been within the acceptable range on all my blood work. During that run I was doing a very dirty keto with lots of processed meats, etc, and a weekly re-feed on carbs (anabolic diet). This go has been much cleaner overall, and relatively strict. There have only been 2-3 cheat meals since January. 

I‚Äôm already supplementing with omega-3 and was given a list of others to look into (red yeast rice, Coq-10, citrus bergamot) because I have no desire to take statins. 

I‚Äôd value input from the r/keto community because I look and feel about as good as ever (other than lifting weights on no carbs which has never not sucked) but I am strongly considering changing my diet if I can‚Äôt get this worked out by my next blood panel.",t3_nrf6uz

Last Friday I had my hemoglobin A1c tested, and it came back at 5.3% (low end of pre-diabetes range is 5.7%). My fasting blood glucose came back at 99 mg/dL, which is right below the pre-diabetic range.

This represents my first A1c test following a full 3 months of keto. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with an A1c of 7.1% in mid-February, which was 2.5 weeks into keto. I had my A1c tested at 5.5% in early April, about 10 weeks into keto. That was also considered in the ""normal range"", but it was still pretty close to pre-diabetic. My fasting glucose was well within the pre-diabetic range at 107 mg/dL, so I still had room for improvement at the time.

I haven't been eating that much differently from April until now, so this lower FBG seems to be due to improved insulin sensitivity.

My liver function also improved further from the previous test on April 15th. My ALT reading dropped from 36 IU/L to 25 IU/L, and my AST reading dropped from 25 IU/L to 19 IU/L.

603,shivering in restaurant,"so i have been doing keto for about 2 weeks now, initially i ate whatever but just made sure to stay under 15-20g of carbs. This week ive been trying to cut back my calories. I ate just after 12 am because my sleep schedule is funny and i just charged that to my carbs for today, i ate 19 net carbs (from peanut butter, of which i ate alot, 3 strawberries and celery).

At 12 pm (12 hours later) i met a friend and they were dying to go to lunch so we went to whetherspoons (UK) and i was finding it hard to find something to eat so i just ordered some chicken wings that came with sauce on the side. when they came they appeared to be slightly coated so i looked up the nutritional information and it said 19.4g of carbs. There were 10 wings so i told myself i'm just going to eat half. I ended up just eating 6 with no sauce and just water to drink. when i was eating the 6th one i started shivering and feeling so ill. i suddenly became extremely cold (it was quite warm all day and we were sitting inside). what could this be? was it shock from the carbs? because really eating 6 would have put me under 15g for that meal and under 35g for the day in total. was that feeling me being kicked out of ketosis?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: i just looked again on the nutritional information menu and there are also 3.9g of fibre that come with the wings ( not sure how lol) so that mean the net carbs were 15.5g but because i ate 6 that would be 9.3g. Im really confused as to how this has caused this reaction in me. ",t3_nrdro7

606,Calling all campers! Also a thank-you to a mystery redditor.,"First, I don't know if it was in this sub or r/ketorecipes, but a couple of months ago a redditor changed my snacking world with a simple recipe: put some cream cheese and everything bagel seasoning into a tortilla, fold in half and grill/toast (I use my George Foreman). IT IS SO DELICIOUS AND SATISFYING. Even with shredded cheeses instead of cream cheese (or mix them!) it is so freaking good. So, if you see this mystery redditor, THANK YOU.

Second, since that was such a hit I thought I'd ask for some help. I need some suggestions from you campers out there. Besides the foil-packet idea, are there any recipes/snack ideas that don't involve me packing up my entire kitchen to make a meal at a campsite? I tent camp so I do all my cooking over a fire and really like to keep things at a minimum. I have a single-burner gas stove I could bring, and I'd be willing to bring one small pot or frying pan if needed, but I don't want to be stuck with a ton of dirty dishes.

I used to eat like trash while camping (think pop-tarts, Pringles, PB&amp;J, cans of chili or ravioli, etc) and while it's tempting to just have a ""cheat weekend"" while I'm in the woods, I'd like to take my healthy lifestyle on the road ...

612,"Ex Vegan, New to Keto with Cholesterol Concerns","(F) (5‚Äô10) (CW210) (GW160) (Age 20)
Hey guys !
 I have cholesterol question.  When i was around 8 or 9 despite being a skinny kid i got high cholesterol. So for the vast majority of my adolescence I was a vegan 15-19. For the most part my weight remained around 165-175 which is not bad because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10 (F). My cholesterol levels were normal also. My diet was basically high carb no fat no protein. When I got to college my weight jumped up to 185. To combat my weight gain I ate really restrictive calories and ruined my relationship with food and dropped down to 155 my lowest weight since middle school. During quarantine i quit veganism due to health concerns. My weight shot up to 210 pounds and my cholesterol is high again.  I have done a lot of work healing my relationship with food but i would like to lose weight so i can leave overweight and bad eating habits in my teen years. Long story short i want to try keto because i believe it will help with my carb and sugar addiction. But after a half a decade of vegan rhetoric i am scared that fats will make me fat and drive my cholesterol up. Can you do keto if you have cholesterol problems? Ive never really eaten dairy or meat so this will be really new to me. I would be so grateful if you could share you keto cholesterol thoughts in the comments as well as any tips about transitioning out of high carb veganism into low carb or keto diets. Thanks guys i hope your support will help me have a strong start.",t3_nqzpvh

623,Help with eating well despite peer pressure?,"I need some advice on sticking to keto when out. I'm very good at sticking to the eating lifestyle, but am often at a loss when going out to eat, especially with my partner or his family (they are Hispanic, and like to eat tortillas, beans, corn, etc... things that are good, but not good for my purposes. I live in a place where Tex-Mex is not only common, but the standard. I'm white, if that makes a difference). Obviously, I don't want to be rude and flat-out refuse such things, but I also don't know how to give an acceptable response that lets me sideline such things.
My partner also enjoys trying to get me to eat out, or trying to take me to bars (I don't drink). He is a food pusher, and I know it comes from a place of love and partly his culture, but I can't seem to make him understand that ""eating a slice of pizza because I deserve it"" or ""you know you can eat more than a salad, right?"" is much lower on my wants and priorities than my health and physique. They are all aware of my dieting to one degree or another, but I still can't help feeling guilty when I'm on the pendulum of either: not eating what they eat (which is primarily stuff I can't tolerate anymore, including pizza and nachos) and feeling stuck-up, or indulging myself to fit in and having set-backs and horrible cramps later because it's hard to limit myself once I go down that path.
I understand that once or twice a month will probably not dent my diet, but the gatherings happen so often that it's a few times each week, either with him or his family. Every time I go out, I feel like a party pooper because I physically can't eat as much as them (or find keto things to eat), and I feel bad like they have to cater to me or something, or else I can't eat. Every time I explain this to my partner, it's in one ear and out the other.
To make matters worse, food is a very important gesture in Hispanic culture, especially when home cooked. I would feel like an asshole if I didn't partake, and I'm sure they would get, at the least, a snooty impression of me as well.

Not from Keto, but from counting and logging and tracking.  Predictably, not logging resulted in not losing, BUT....because I stayed more or less Keto, I also did not gain!  Throughout the past two months I have hovered in the same 5 pound range.

A couple of weeks ago I resolved to get back to logging so that I could get the scale moving again.  It worked, and I saw 199 on my scale for the first time on Sunday in well over 15 years.  Of course there are progress pics.

My in-laws know that I am not eating carbs, but don't really know what eating keto means.

We went to visit them this weekend and lunch was burgers (good), mushrooms (good), and black bean and corn salad (bad!). So, I had a bunless cheeseburger with mushrooms. MIL asked if I wanted ketchup or anything for the burger. I politely declined.

We go out for ice cream. I skip it.

Then, it's dinner talk. MIL lists the side options she can make with pork chops: corn on the cob, potatoes, salad, more of the black bean salad from earlier. I go with salad with ranch. Everyone else goes with salad to make cooking easier. Am I rubbing off on them? 

Nope!

After dinner, the eating continues. A neighbor brought by white chocolate bars with red and blue sprinkles to have with smores. Not for me, thanks. 

FIL looks directly at me and points out that there are Heath bars and Paydays in the fridge. Nope, I'm good. 

I am still hungry though, so I munch on some pecans, pumpkin seeds, and summer sausage.

660,Going Keto after almost dying...help appreciated.,"Three weeks ago I was found unresponsive in bed by my husband. I had what‚Äôs called agonal breathing which is when your brain stem is breathing for you in slow gasps as you circle the drain. I remember nothing and I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt. He performed chest compressions until EMS helicoptered me to the hospital where I was intubated on a ventilator for 5 days. They believe this was caused from me having a bad cough and aspirating fluid in my sleep. 

My doctor thinks it‚Äôs also linked to sleep apnea and plans to do a sleep study to confirm. I am slightly overweight, however I‚Äôm still holding onto weight from giving birth six months ago. He wants me to lose weight, especially since what happened.  

My husband has decided we‚Äôre both changing our lifestyles to be healthier overall and since his parents have had great results with keto, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing. Yesterday we donated everything in our house that‚Äôs not keto and fully re-stocked our kitchen to be keto-friendly.

My Fasting Insulin has gone down -- from a high of 11 to 8 to 5... but 5 seems to be the lowest number - as after months of keto it hasn't gone lower.

This kind of matters because I have a theory that the lower the insulin the easier weight loss. I was reading a story last night about natural fasting insulin levels in women that were low (under 3) and the vast majority of them were thin. 

So I was wondering if people knew if your insulin could drop after years on keto but it might take a long time.",t3_nqkgdl

But about a week ago, I went to an urgent care dr for vertigo. Lots of fluid behind my ears. Great. We knew what was wrong. But my BP was super high.

672,One Year Ketoversary today....didn't quite hit my goal,"TL/DR Aimed to lose 100lb in 12 months....fell agonisingly short, but a loss is a loss and failing is failing.

So today is the one year anniversary since I hopped back up on the wagon again.

I posted a few weeks back about hitting 279 (being a Brit that meant under 20st and so was a small whoop moment), but my desire was to be one of those people who loses 100lb or more in a year.

June 1st 2020 my scales read 367 on the nose.......June 1st 2021 they read 267.2lb

Honestly guys, I failed. 

I know I could round down, and my partner told me effectively that ""99.8lb basically is 100lb"", but I'm going to remain accountable in this, it's the thing that keeps me going at it.

If I start rounding here and there , I feel like I'll lose sight of the actuality of the situation, as I am still a fair way off where I want to and need to be.

I'll hit the hundo, it'll be tomorrow or the next day, and it's really only a milestone to tick off along the way, but DAMN I really wanted to do it in a year! I know that's stupid, but it was something I wanted so badly!

But it is what it is.

Anyhoo....the plan is to keep on trucking, 58.2lbs in the next year is the plan, just over a lb a week and then onto the remaining 30lbs or so (which I think will be the hardest!)

For today, it's a sense of ""almost but not quite"", mixed in with an appreciation that at least I start these 12 months from almost 100lb better off than last year.

KCKO Kiddos, it does work....just not always at the pace you want it to.....and I'm OK with that

I lost 6lbs in 6 days, my chronic abdominal bloating is gone and although it‚Äôs highly likely that the pounds I dropped are just water weight I‚Äôm still very happy about it. 

The only thing is that I find it incredibly hard to meet my daily macro goals (89g proteins, 110g fat, carb is at 18g but it‚Äôs fine). I‚Äôm roughly 5‚Äù4 and I started at 148lb. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this diet to make my stomach feel so full all day and once it‚Äôs dinner time I literally have to force myself to eat. It might be the morning keto coffee that cuts my hunger completely but honestly if it were for me I would skip a meal but then i wouldn‚Äôt meet my macros unless I eat more in the two other meals and that seems overwhelming. I‚Äôve been on a 20g deficit on average for both proteins and fats for three days now and I always have about 200-300 calories deficit at the end of the day (goal is 1400 kcal).

683,Frequent urination on keto,"Hi guys, just had a quick question in regards to very frequent urination on the keto diet. I've been on and off of the keto diet for approximately a year. I started at 270 pounds (at my highest) and now currently hovering around 228 pounds. I feel great. High energy, and eating healthy on a daily basis. When I started back up 2 months ago, I was roughly 254 pounds. I am a 23 year old male. 

My main question is that the frequent urination with this diet is still extremely prevalent from the get go. I noticed that I'm peeing more and more throughout the day even 2 months in. I also want to note I drink a lot of water as well throughout the day, honestly I would say over 6 litres of water. BUT I am not necessarily thirsty all the time, thats why I don't believe it is type 2 diabetes. I am drinking a lot of water due to my activity level. I exercise every day with frequent walks and weight lifting. 

 I also practice intermittent fasting (practically daily) using a 20:4 and/or 16:8 strategy. When it comes to drinking towards night time, I noticed that I cannot drink past 7 pm or I am up all night emptying my bladder. 

Can this be a sign of insulin resistance/pre diabetes and I just need to stay on track longer in order to correct this frequent urination? How long does it take to correct insulin resistance/pre diabetes symptoms? Overall, I don't want to jump to conclusions but wanted to get everyone's opinions. Cause frequent urination (from my research) should only last a couple of weeks. Please let me know your thoughts.",t3_npu028

685,Weigh in today,"I did my monthly weigh in this morning, 328.7 lb. I started at 367. That means, that as of today, I've lost 38.3 lb on keto!

I've also gotten the courage to change my goal. At first it was just going to be to get down to 299. I figured if I could break 300 maybe I could do more. Well I've seen now for sure that I will be able to break 300.

I then decided well, 250 doesn't sound too bad. So I decided that I would make my goal weight 250. But, using the same logic as above, if I can achieve 250, I can achieve more. So far, and 4 months I've taken off almost 40 lb. Surely I can do more!

I enlisted in the Air Force in 1977. My way in weight was 185 lb. I've decided, that that's my goal! Now, it may be too ambitious. After all, that was 45 years ago. Maybe I'll decide that 215 lb will work just fine. Nonetheless, I like the sound of being 185.

We'll see how it goes. Thanks so much for all your help and support on the way.

Long Story Short: **Back in February 11 of 2019, I started Strict Keto** and lost like 70 Pounds in 7 Months, then I slowed down a bit. Then Covid hit and I ‚Äúslipped‚Äù for a month, saying I‚Äôd bounce back‚Ä¶ **I didn‚Äôt bounce back.  Now I am 290 Pounds from my original 319 when I first started**, so it could definitely be better, but at least I‚Äôm not at my worst. 

I know a good chunk of you (especially a certain lady who surfs the Internet a lot) will probably say ‚ÄúI lack discipline, keep Keto in your Control‚Äù and stuff like that, but **I also delt with some life changing moments during Covid and some big changes will be happening to my life very soon, excluding my dietary changes.**

So I ask again; **What do I need to know to kick myself back into and permanently stay in Keto?** I updated my basic Macros and got this for a 20% Deficit. Ask for more details if needed. Here they are:

Protein: 160

Fat: 160

Net Carbs: 20

Calories: 2100

693,How much salt do you take and how do you get enough,"I‚Äôve been loosely keto for a few years but recently somehow noticed I‚Äôve been too lethargic, can‚Äôt muster the energy to do the things I want. A light bulb went off in my head yesterday and I realised I might have been forgetting about salt intake (I think I‚Äôve been averaging a little more than 1g a day) and I took a tiny spoon of salt (about 0.5g) and washed down with water. And a while later I actually felt like things were beginning to work like my gears inside were oiled or smth. I woke up in the morning and felt like I had *ready* energy, smth I haven‚Äôt felt in a while. 

I actually premix snake juice in a jar plus some other stuff like taurine and I add a tablespoon everyday to my 1 litre of water, so on average I should get 1.35g of elemental potassium and 400mg of magnesium a day, but I lower the percentage of sodium (~200mg) because I feel like it makes the water too salty to drink. On top of that I eat OMAD out of convenience where I cook and usually add MAX 1.5g of salt. I tried adding more today but it‚Äôs noticeably too salty. The rest of the day I usually snack on macadamia nuts, protein shake, berries, milk, avocados or keto waffles etc so there‚Äôs nothing for me to add salt to, except when I make eggs.

1. The recommended sodium intake is 3g daily, and that works out to be 7.7g given that sodium is only 52% of sodium chloride. How much salt do most of you take daily? Do you feel a difference on high vs low salt intake?
2. Those who do OMAD how do you get enough salt? In fact how do you get 7.7g of salt a day even without OMAD.. I weighed it out and it looks like a whole tablespoon
3. Is it safe to wash down half to 1g of salt at one go. After doing that yesterday I feel like I‚Äôve been feeling things in my lower back (where your kidneys are), and now too after a saltier than usual dinner and my right arm is weirdly tingly. That can‚Äôt be good right? Even tho I feel like I‚Äôm having more energy. Are most of your bodies ok on high sodium?",t3_npv05l
694,Down 13 lbs in 4 weeks -- I'm officially back!,"[https://imgur.com/gallery/hBRG9hu](https://imgur.com/gallery/hBRG9hu)

Started keto again 4 weeks ago. I did keto 3 years ago and I reached my goal weight but I gained everything back and more during that 3 years. A lot of factors to consider, some are somewhat valid (lockdown, started working in a commercial kitchen) but if I'm being honest it was just lack of discipline and the mentality that ""it's easy to lose weight in keto"". I tried countless times to ""re-start"" but found it a lot more difficult than it was 3 years ago. Now, finally I'm able to sustain it again and I have more motivation. I'm coupling the diet with exercise and I just want to share the result here for accountability.

698,Down 10 pounds!!!,"I've been eating macadamia nuts, chicken (hearts, livers, thighs, breats), no bread and gluten free, not even keto bread. My almond flour and protein powder just arrived so I haven't even touched those yet. But monkfruit in my coffee, and salads with lean protein and added fats, steak, seafood, and all that yummy stuf are regulars in my diet and I lost 10 fricking pounds since  May 13th!!!",t3_np41jy
699,Just how much better is it possible to feel with Keto?,"For example, if you've never worked out before, and you spend 4 committed months in the gym, the change is slow, but difference after 4 months is dramatic.

Likewise, if you did Keto for 4 months after eating pizza an donuts 4-5 nights a week, would the difference be similar? I know everyone is different, but im just wondering if anyone has stories of \*dramatic improvement.

I have very disabling, and worsening tinnitus, and im only 24 (extremely depressing) . Ive done a complete tour of the medical field for solutions, and im out of luck. I believe its worsening from an autoimmune response in my jaw joint. My diet has been absolutely garbage for many many years, with the exception of a morning smoothie. My stools and bowels have been horrid for almost a decade. I have ED already at 24, and my hairline is receding fast (hormone tests come back regular but these are symptoms of hormonal imbalance?) I'm 1.5 weeks into candida diet, and haven't gotten worse in tinnitus during that time. It was hard for the first week but I'm actually enjoying it now. It seems promising, but I'm just wondering what I can expect the ceiling of improvement form this diet to be. Any great stories?",t3_npmee2
700,Sola is my new favorite keto bread!,"I went to my local Safeway looking to get Franz hamburger buns, but they were sold out.

However, they just got in a shipment of Sola bread, which is sort of like a unicorn--I had never seen it not sold out before. I heard some things about this brand, so I grabbed a loaf of the ""golden wheat"" and ""sweet and buttery"".

I toasted a couple of slices of the ""golden wheat"" to have with eggs and sausage this morning, and they were awesome! This bread toasts great--they retain the moisture, softness, and slight chewiness inside the toasted layer just like regular white bread.

I also ate the mangled slice of the heel untoasted, and I loved the chewiness. There's a slight savory/salty flavor to them, which I kind of like, but otherwise, this is about as close to regular bread I've tasted so far in a keto bread. I'm guessing that the ""sweet and buttery"" won't be as savory. I'm looking forward to trying that one next--maybe with peanut butter.

So my updated keto bread rankings are as follows:

Untoasted:
1. Sola Golden Wheat
2. Franz Keto (aka Keto Culture)
3. Artisan Bakers Multi-seed Keto
4. Oroweat Keto

Toasted:
1. Sola Golden Wheat
2. Oroweat Keto
3. Franz Keto
4. Artisan Bakers Multi-seed Keto

Note: I followed the recommendation of another poster (apologies for forgetting your user name) to pan-fry the Oroweat with butter, and it's great this way. Otherwise, it's dead last when using a toaster. It ends up so dry, it's terrible. 

Although Sola is my new favorite, I do have some criticisms. While it's touted as having only 2g net carbs per slice, the serving size is the smallest of these brands at 26g. The serving size of the Artisan and Oroweat is 28g, while Franz is 30g.

The Sola is also the highest in calories at 70 calories per slice. Oroweat is 60 calories, while Franz and Artisan are 40 calories per slice. Note that both Franz and Artisan also tout 100% of carbs from fiber (i.e. zero net carbs), which makes their calorie content more inline with their fiber claim.

While Sola is the most caloric of these breads, the macros that they list are the most ""honest"" in terms of calories. The listed macros are undercounted by the equivalent of 6 only calories compared to the listed calories. (64 calories via macros vs. 70 calories listed).

The other brands are undercounting macros by the equivalent of 10 to 14 calories with respect to the listed calories.",t3_npb91e
701,General noob questions,"I'm very new to keto, just dipping my toes in as I transition from carbs to fats and learn more what's good for me. Ate a ridiculous amount of goose fat yesterday and felt very sick. Trial and error and basic ignorance at work here so be kind. Anyway, I've just been wondering how we came to a conclusion about the specific percentages of fats, proteins, and carbs in the diet. If keto, like paleo, is based in principle on ancient hunter-gatherer diets, why do we have to limit ourselves to a certain amount of fat and protein? Wouldn't our ancestors have gotten a lot more protein than is recommended on keto? Am I wrong to link the modern keto diet with a primitive diet? I mean, they wouldn't have been able to weigh them out as we can, so why, exactly, should we? I feel like these questions have a very simple answer I am not getting yet so I hope they're not too dense. Thanks.",t3_npsld4
702,Keto beef stew,"Hey everyone,

703,Having trouble finding out why I can't get into ketosis,"I'm new to keto. I'm currently six days in, I bought a ketone breathiliezer and I keep getting a reading of 0.2-0.4 mmol/L. I can't seem to get over the 0.5 mark. For the last six days I've been consistently eating 200g fat, 100g protein, 20g carb. My diet before this was mostly carbs, so I'm thinking the problem is that my glycogen reserves are just taking awhile to be used up. I don't mind it taking a bit to get my numbers where they need to be but it was really disheartening to find out after almost a week, I'm still at square one. Any tips or advice from Yahoo that have been here and found something to get your numbers where they needed to be or if I just need to have some patience would really be appreciated.",t3_npr6al

705,Macro calculator says more grams of protein than grams of fat. I am confused.,"I have read articles online that state that if you eat too much protein, your body will turn the protein into glucose and burn that instead of fat.

Yet when I do the keto calculator on this site, it is putting my macros with more grams of protein than fat.

I am guessing this is because each gram of fat has more calories? The 60/35/5 ratios I am seeing represent percentages of total caloric intake, not measurements in total grams consumed?

I guess this is a stupid question, but when I got my macros on this site I was confused that the recommended grams of protein was higher than fat. 

I am new to this, and I have been concerned about eating too much protein because then my body will turn it into glucose and use it as energy instead of burning fat and thus slow or prevent ketosis. Do I have nothing to worry about?

Any help or clarification would be appreciated. Thanks!",t3_npr1xi

707,Memories of The New You,"Memorial Day here in 'Merica has always been an interesting day to me.  It was originally set aside to pay tribute to those who died in the military.  My family took things a bit further and put flowers on the graves of all our loved ones who have passed.  Later in the day, we would have a ""family get together"" and celebrate family.  For a while, it was five generations of BigTexans and it was glorious.  I think those who we mourned on those days would be proud that we also celebrated life on the same days.

***Old Memories...***              

It wasn't that long ago that I was too fat to go to family get togethers.  Too embarrassed to want to be seen by my family.  Hell, they knew me when I was ""kickass football"" BigTex and I damn sure didn't want them to see me as ""too fat to put on socks"" BigTex.  One year we had a family reunion in Branson Missouri.  We stayed in these houses on the lake.  The house I stayed in was 50 yards from the main house.  I had to rent a golf cart because I couldn't walk that far.  I'll never forget how my family looked at me.  The sadness in my Aunt's eyes.  I was 48 years old and my 74 year old Uncle got up to give me his chair.  Another Uncle damn near killed himself trying to help me get in the boat, but I couldn't make it.  I was too damn fat to fish.  So many shitty memories.  I cannot control those memories but they do serve to remind me that the past has passed.           

The past has passed.          

***New Memories...***        

I am no longer 600 pound BigTexan.  I treated my body like a dumpster fire and it's falling apart, but I still walked 12,000 steps today.   Just hiking along the creek.  Watching the puppy chase a couple of butterflies was pretty cute.  Watching her stalk a lizard was funny.   Seeing some friends walking the same  trail was nice.  Sitting on the big rock with them while their kids and the puppy played in the water.    Those will be good memories.   

About three years ago, something dawned on me.  I can control my memories.  Now, I can't control the memories of my past, but I can control my new memories.  I can control my new memories by celebrating my life.  Look, my life is still a shit show on so many levels, but I can put on socks.  I can fish.  I will always remember the puppy trying to bite the waves the kids were splashing at her.  The sounds of those kids laughing.  The pride I saw in their parent's eyes.         

***A Celebration of Life...***        

I control my new memories by being resolved to make today memorable.  Not just another day, but A NEW DAY.  A new day full of victories.  A new day full of angst.  A new day full of laughter.  Full of sadness.  Full of joy and full of heartache.  A day full of memories.  I can control my memories by choosing to find the good in each day.    

I sometimes  say, ""trapped in fat"".  When I was 600 pound BigTex, trapped in fat was pretty damn literal.  ""Oh, we can't eat at that restaurant because the chairs have arms and I don't fit in them.""  ""We can't go to that movie because the armrests don't lift up and I can't fit in the seat.""   ""There is no way I'll be able to go to walk around the mall.""  Every damn decision I made was centered around my fatness.  That's what being fat does to you physically.  It traps you.    

But you can also be mentally trapped in fat.  ""When I get to XYZ pounds, I am going to do...."" is something I thought about all the time.  ""If only I was less fat, I could do..."".  At one point, I was going to live a grand life...someday.   At first glance, the above might sound logical, but alas, it is simply the musings of a mind trapped in fat.      

That day three years  ago was a big big day for me.  I realized that not only can I control my memories, but  I can also stop WAITING to live my new life.  Stop waiting for XY and Z and start doing.  Every morning I open my eyes to a day full of...well, full of new memories.        

***What If I Fail...***     

Hello Lurkers.  Hello Newbies.  Hello Strugglers.  Haunted by your memories.  Shackled by the sheer weight of your memories.  Always looking back over your shoulder.  Always asking yourself, ""what if I fail?""  What is that?  Well that's your mind being trapped in fat.  Your mind trapped in fat and being guarded by doubts.  See, the real issue is that right now, you don't see a path.  You don't see a path to hope.  A path to confidence.  Right now, you can't see a path to victory.  But don't worry, the path is easy to find.  Turn around.  Yep.  That's it, just turn around.  You see, this whole time, you have been concentrating on your memories.  Concentrating on the life behind you, rather than looking at the life ahead of you.    

So turn around and look at your future.  Oh, it might look a bit scary.  Full of water that looks deep.  All you see is uncertainty but that uncertainty is simply your old memories trying to win.  Trying to pull you down.  So push those memories aside for a minute and look at your future again.  Look at your future and ask yourself this question:      

***What If I Succeed...***                   

Look again at your future and ask yourself, ""what if I succeed?""  Now, your future doesn't look scary but instead is full of opportunities.  That water isn't deep but instead it is warm.  And when you jump in, that water will cleanse you.  Cleanse you of your old memories.  Ask yourself, ""what if I succeed?"" and your future is no longer uncertain but instead is full of promise.  ""What if I succeed?"" is the question that begins to free you from all of your bad memories.     

***Memories Of The New You...***       

This year, Memorial Day is special in a different way.  It has always been the de facto beginning to the summer, but as we begin to see a lifting of the pandemic, it is the beginning of a summer that can be full of new and full of special.  So here's what we are going to do.  We are going to eat  keto at a 20% deficit.  Sounds simple yet at times, it can be difficult.  But we will embrace the difficulties because those difficulties are our opportunities for victory.  So we will eat keto.       

We will eat keto and in a couple of weeks, we will start to feel hope.  One day, we will wake up and say, ""Hey, maybe this keto stuff will work"".  And this will be a grand day because we will dare to dream.  We will keep eating keto and some goofy stuff will happen.  We will not hesitate to turn down food.  We will see people eating something and it just won't phase us.  We will see them eating something and we will feel nothing.  And we will realize that we are in control.  And that is a grand day because it is the day all our bad thoughts are washed away.  It is the day that we stop being haunted by our memories.  At this point, we are feeling pretty damn good.  Full of hope and in control.  But one day soon, we will wake up and be full of confidence.  And that is a grand day because it's the day we know we are going to win.          

Hope.  Control.  Confidence.  That's how you will live your new life.  

Full of hope that allows you to dream.     

In control so you are freed from your past.      

Full of confidence that guarantees your victory.    

That's The New You.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes and imagine yourself.  Imagine yourself full of hope and dreaming.  Imagine yourself with control and freed from your past.  Close your eyes and imagine yourself so full of confidence that you know you will win.                

Imagine all of those things please.       

Imagine those things because they are your new beginning.     

They are the memories of the new you.",t3_noxjzq
708,Giant poops on Keto?,"Hello! Bit gritty, but can't really find much info on this so here goes!

I've been on keto/OMAD for about 7 weeks now and it's going great - the only downside is my stools have started (what feels like) doubling in size?? I poop once every 2-3 days and when I do, it feels like they're coming out sideways. I'm being split open!!!

709,Lose a couple of pounds per month without even working for it!,"Would you like to burn a few hundred extra calories per day? Well, if you work at a desk, the easy thing for you to do is to simply stand up!

Depending on your size and weight, you will use 50 to 100 calories more per hour, simply by standing up at work, rather than sitting down. So, if you stand up for 7 hours a day, you'll burn an additional 350 calories. Every 10 days is 3,500 additional calories burned. Since there are about 22 work days in every month, theoretically speaking, you could lose 2 lb a month, just by standing up at your desk!

I have been doing this, and have found standing up at work to be quite helpful. My legs tend to be very tired at the end of the day, so I know that I'm using muscles that I don't normally use. It never occurred to me that simply standing up would be an easy way to burn more calories.",t3_npe3iy

712,Thanks for handing me my ass back!,"Last year I got pregnant after a month on Keto after two years of trying/tests etc. We now have the most wonderful little 7 month boy who is a joy every single day. So thank you as ever to this community for making that happen.

Unfortunately Mama had gestational diabetes and a restricted diet while pregnant so when baby came along with sleepless night, lockdown, moving apartment etc....I went mad on biscuits, cakes, chocolate sent as gifts. Couple that with exhausted meals of pasta and takeout and...I actually put on weight after giving birth \*embarrassed emoji\*.

Anyway!! Three weeks ago I got back on the Keto wagon. We have a great kitchen in our new place and I love cooking in it. I live in Europe so farmer's markets are cheap and plentiful and the produce is \*amazing\*. I'm eating seasonally and have never eaten so deliciously. My husband said I'm like a new person...I feel so confident and happy because I no longer feel helpless about what I'm eating. My anxiety pretty much disappeared immediately...as did my sore joints, night terrors - all the other associated crap I had with a 'standard diet'. Also...

I've lost over 10lbs in 3 weeks!! I'm back in my pre-pregnancy jeans. It's also third of my goal to get to 'healthy' weight and have never been hungry or had a craving (except once when I got my Covid vaccine!). I've still had a lime, vodka, soda when I fancy, bunless Maccie Ds, and a mug cake too but mostly have cooked from scratch using my carbs for veggies.  I stayed mostly under 23 grams net carbs, did some days 18/6 IF and this time had bulletproof coffee with MCT oil and collagen. Oh, and have gone 100% embarrassing mom and have taken up rollerblading.

It's not actually such a huge difference but I feel like myself again and know I can model health to my little son too. I guess this incredibly long post is just saying thank you to this community which has always helped keep me going and to put my success somewhere for accountability too!

716,Holy blood pressure drop Batman,"I‚Äôve had TERRIBLY high blood pressure for over a year, both due to diet and anxiety.  At one point (I‚Äôm only 32 by the way and not insanely overweight) it was 200/105‚Äìthis was at a follow up appointment for a surgery and the doctor made me leave his office to go to the ER.  Once I got my anxiety under control and started taking some BP Meds, it was a lot better but still too high.

I know alcohol affected it greatly, because whenever I cut down it would go down and when I began having wine again, it would go up.  Still, at its best, it would linger around 140/90.

Finally decided to go back to a keto lifestyle as well as cutting out any alcohol (easier decision when it adds too many calories for my macros anyway).  I‚Äôm only a few weeks in and decided to check my blood pressure today‚Äî127/82.  I know it‚Äôs not perfect but those are the lowest numbers I‚Äôve seen in a year and LITERALLY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE is that I‚Äôve been doing keto and intermittent fasting for a few weeks.

723,Going over carb limit improves my sleep dramatically? Any tips?,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could offer their thoughts on this. I'm 23 F, 5'2 and 105 lbs and have some exercise most days/am fairly lean. I went through the keto flu several weeks ago and have been mostly in ketosis (I think) since, though I've had some slip-ups. I fast often (16-40 hours) which I think helps me get back in quicker. I'm not doing this diet for weight loss or diabetes, but for mental health disorders (depression, OCD) and a mild connective tissue disorder that causes some chronic pain and fatigue (hypermobility). I've also had digestive issues it has helped with a lot (malabsorbtion).
 
Keto has been awesome, my brain feels ""fresh"", OCD improved a lot, depression a little less severe, digestive issues mostly gone, all of that. The only problem is, I can't sleep at all when I'm doing 20g carbs or less. I can fall asleep, but I wake up several times throughout the night, sometimes drenched in sweat. When I wake up, it's 5 hours later and I can't back to sleep, so I'll have a very high-energy morning and then often I'll crash around noon from probably sleep-deprivation. 

The problem is 30g carbs makes me sleep perfectly through the night. Thing is, the sidebar macro calculator actually tells me I need to be under 16 g carbs per day, so I doubt I can be in ketosis with that amount. *And yes, I supplement plenty of sodium, potassium and magnesium before bed and all day long*. I've heard about supplementing L-Tryptophan before bed, and have read about the mechanism behind it, which makes sense, but worry about how this could affect my sleep if I ever went off. I am also considering a cheap blood-glucose monitor to see if this is blood-sugar related. 

Has anyone else experienced this, or have any tips?

 In summary, after starting keto, 15 days of keto the trend has gone from low fasting blood glucose (70 and below) fasting blood glucose to currently 90-105 and stable with no lows but much elevated - increase of 20 fasting glucose.

First 6 days of keto, fasting blood glucose 80-85, lowered blood sugars &gt;90 no lows below 70, no spikes 

Days 7-12 irregular blood sugars with fasting blood glucose 59-70 and crappy feeling, no spikes in blood sugar above 100

Days 12-15 fasting blood glucose is 90-105 way higher than previously - is very consistent and stable as where days 7-12 were extremely volatile 

But fasting blood glucose has increased

Would rather just eat a balanced diet if it‚Äôs going to mess up my blood sugars and insulin resistance - I read about physiological insulin resistance vs the other

Why would my blood sugar be stable and good, then low and unstable, now stable and elevated

725,Keto Mood Improvement is worth it alone! Is this from keto or better health?,"Is this just a side effect of being healthier? I go in and out of keto often. I lost a bunch of weight and now I do keto 5 days per week then do 2 days of calorie counting with some fruit and decent carbs and some cheats. I go in and out of keto easily after months of this.

I lost a bunch of weight on keto, got off my CPAP and just love my energy and brain power on keto...but ive also noticed my mood is way better on keto. 

Anyone else notice improved moods on keto? My anxiety is OFF on keto and I am just in a great mood. On my 2 days off I usually see the anxiety and short temper and poor moods creep back.

In any case I love keto and I wonder if yet another affect for some could be mood, anxiety maybe depression improvements?",t3_nogra5
726,I'd like to read your experiences.,"Hi, I'm new on all the keto diet, I actually just started a few hours ago with some articles that I read on the internet.

I'm 17 I'm not overweight I just thought it would be fine if I get more lean, I've heard that this diet is kinda difficult and quite expensive, so I thought that reading your experiences and struggle would help me to understand better all this process. Thank you!",t3_npcqoo
727,Cream of tartar as a Potassium Supplement?,"A bit of a weird situation but I've been doing keto for some time and have been feeling off. Started tracking my electrolytes and everything else is fine... but potassium.

I wanted to buy some potassium chloride (lo-salt/lite salt) but my parents are heavily against it thinking its dangerous (my parents brothers are doctors and they basically said that its dangerous). Tried convincing them but nope, no luck. So I'm tryna find a loophole and it seems like cream of tartar is really high in potassium, has anyone had any experiences?

728,Can't recover since 1st period-need perspective and support,"Dear Keto Friends,

I'm losing hope.  I've been on Keto for about 5 weeks.  Lost 7 pounds in three weeks.  Period came and gained back all of it.  Now I'm two weeks post period in ovulation up 2 more pounds.  I'm netting +2.  I feel deprived and hopeless.

Goals: 99g fat, 20g carbs, 75g protein.  
1300 Calories

Sometimes, I exceed fat up to +20g, meet or go under the protein, almost always under 20g carbs (and only exceed by 2g most).

I am runner.  I run about 20-25 miles each week.

Helpful anecdotes or thoughts?

Maybe this isn't going to work for me?

Thank you so much.

733,Daily gain after eating at 6 pm the day before?,"Keto Day 9 (down 10.1 lbs / 2.6% bodyweight)

I'm wondering if there's a reason why, on the two days after I ate at 6 pm, I had a weight gain?

On 6 of the previous days, the latest I ate was at 4ish. On 2 of the days, I ate at 6 or a bit later and woke up to a weight gain. On all the other days, I always had a weight loss.

The only other thing the two days had in common was that someone else cooked my dinner (one at Cracker Barrell (steak with steamed broccoli and green beans) and the other at a friend's house (steak and salad)).

I know these are early days, but this pattern strikes me as significant, although it may be coincidental.

Any insight is appreciated!",t3_np5v79

737,Stomach problem making me do keto.,"TLDR: My stomach got better after no carbs.

Ok so the past two weeks I've been having this proplem with my food intake, it seemed like everything I ate made me sick.

I couldn't keep food down and I dreaded eating but I knew I had to figure out what was wrong in the first place, and so I started keeping notes on what I eat to figure out what could be the cause and of day 15 (yesterday) of this sickness I have cut it down to 3 things.

Grease
Spice
Carbs

So today instead of eating my normally cereal, sandwich and big bowl of rice, I had rashers in lettuce and chicken and veg. And I can safely say this is the best I've felt all month. I know I should still go to the doctors to get the facts straight but eating no carbs felt amazing.

I'm going to try to eat no/ low carbs for a while but I'll keep you guys updated if you'd want.",t3_nogau9

739,Magnesium,"Has anyone here experimented with different forms of magnesium and noticed different effects from them (some forms make you more tired or give diarrhea easier or ease muscle cramps faster)?

I got magnesium citrate because I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs considered one of the more bio available forms but now I‚Äôm seeing elsewhere that it‚Äôs one of the least bioavailable. Most seem to agree that oxide is the least bioavailable. When they are absorbed less by your body, I think they‚Äôre more likely to cause loose stool and not be effective for what you want them for (unless that would be to get your system moving).",t3_nopkeb

It was all texture for me and pretty easy to replace those textures with better foods. If you‚Äôre struggling, keep going because it gets so easy!!!!",t3_nnq36j
741,"Maple Hill Zero Sugar (zero carb) milk review, part 2 (Whole milk version this time)","Hi everyone. A couple of days ago I posted a review about the new Maple Hill Zero carb reduced fat milk, and stated I would try to find and review the whole milk version, which I was able to also find at Whole Foods today. After trying the reduced fat version, which I did not like at all and will not buy again, I did not have high expectations for the whole milk version. I tried the whole milk version just now, and it is SO MUCH better. There is about 3g more fat per serving compared to the reduced fat version, and it makes a world of difference. It is much less watery, chalky, and it tastes about 80%-90% of what regular milk would taste and feel like in the mouth (the reduced fat one has a weird thickness to it). It is just a bit more bland compared to regular milk, but otherwise it is very similar and is definitely milk. This will definitely be a new staple for me, and I hope those who are sick of low carb nut milks will be able to find and enjoy this new *real* milk.",t3_nhh0ys
